<p>Three sets of Borens traveled in successive years from Iowa to Utah.</p>
<h1 id="relationships">Relationships:</h1>
<p>Charles Joseph Boren and his wife Mary had among his children two sons who will become Mormons:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>Basil Boren</strong> and his wife Susanna Bryan, who had among their children:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>Mary Boren</strong>, whose first husband was Jacob Young. Among their children was William <strong>Alva Young</strong>, who would take as a plural wife his cousin <strong>Druscilla</strong>.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>Coleman Boren,</strong> who would marry <strong>Melinda Keller</strong></p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>John Boren, who with wife Sarah Alley had at least 2 children:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>

</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>Willis William Boren</strong>, who would marry his cousin <strong>Mary Boren</strong> (above), after she was deserted by her first husband; he would raise her children as his own, and together they had 8 more children.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="staging-areas">Staging Areas</h1>
<p>In 1849 it is unclear where Nathan is when Druscilla, at Winter Quarters, agrees to become the second plural wife of her cousin, William Alma Young. This is common practice in the staging camps; men were expected to be responsible for the women and children, who greatly outnumbered the men as so many were off in the Mormon Battalion or blazing trails for the pioneers who would follow them, or on missions in Britain. Perhaps she thought Nathan was deceased?</p>
<p>William Alva Young and his first wife, Leah and their children go to Utah with the Gully/Spencer train in 1849, and are found on the Utah census in 1850. Druscilla, however, is in Pottawattamie in the 1850 census. She is living in Harrison Precinct of Pottawattamie County in the Iowa State Census in 1852. She is listed on the same page as her brothers A.D, A.B.. and Bev Boren (and also Benjamin Gardner). Only the head of household is listed on this census, and most of the names are male, so likely if Nathan were there, his name would have been mentioned. Druscilla is living with 5 males, four of which are likely her sons, and the fifth is indicated as being “military.” Uncertain to whom this might refer. A family group sheet<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> indicates that Nathan passed away about 1850 in Mt. Pisgah.</p>
<h1 id="wagon-trains-to-utah">Wagon Trains to Utah</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><blockquote>
<p><em>1851 in the Garden Grove</em> train: Patriarch <strong>Basil Boren</strong> and wife Susanna, their son <strong>Coleman</strong> and his wife, Melinda Keller, and their kids.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><em>1852 Benjamin Gardner</em> train: <strong>Bev Boren</strong>, wife Mary Frances, son William Brigham, and two young children who died on the journey: Hosea and Lucretia. Per William’s history, Cyrus, Benjamin, and Ephriam were with the family, just not mentioned in the LDS database. Sister and Maryette was born on the trail.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>(<em>1853 Miller/Cooley Train:</em> Willis Boren and his new second wife, Mary Sampson. First wife Mary Boren had died in Iowa in 1848. William and Mary travelled with one other Boren but that person is not identified. All of Willis and first wife Mary’s children were grown by this time.</p>

<h1 id="in-utah">In Utah</h1>
<p>After a few days in the Mormon capitol we were sent to Provo, where we spent the winter. We suffered many hardships in Provo, which was a new place. An Indian war was raging at that time, and we had to be very careful.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;June 25, 1853. A war commenced with the Utah Indians ... About fifteen Indians was killed and near the same number of Mormons ware killed. All the people that lived on farms were compeled to leave Thayer farms and fort up. I left my farm by order of George Smith and I moved into Palmyra and rebilt and I got comfortably fixed.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>George A. Smith, the LDS apostle Brigham Young appointed to supervise Utah Valley settlements in 1852, took a special interest in Palmyra. On Nov. 23, 1851, he wrote to Franklin D. Richards in England: &quot;A fine settlement is formed on the Spanish Fork in Utah County.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="questions"> Questions:</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><blockquote>
<p>When did A.D. Boren, his wife Adeline Matthis, and their children Elmina, Sarah, Wilford and Lenora, all of whom were in Pottawattamie in 1850 and went to Utah then San Bernardino, travel to Utah? Not in the database.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>When did Druscilla Boren travel to Utah? She was in Pottawattamie in 1850 living near her brothers A.D. and Bev. She is in Utah by 1852—if that is when her marriage was indeed sealed to William Alva Young—but if that did not happen until 1853, she could have traveled with Willis Boren. Willis was her uncle (the brother of her father, Hosea) and had married her father’s first cousin, Mary, who was the mother of her new husband, William Alma Young. Can we confirm the date her marriage to William was sealed in SLC?</p>
