<p>“The <em>Index</em> of San Bernardino,” –</p>
<p>The <em>Index</em> gives a chapter in the story, thus: “It isn’t every day in the year that funny things happen. Sometimes they double up, and then again they quadruple. The latest is a trifle amusing. It is thrown out in chunks, not in the plain, everyday way. The reader possessed with a memory will recall the article published in the <em>Index</em> reciting the arrest of a man named Corrigan, who had a playful bahit of picking up diamond rings from the dusts of the road, and disposing of the same to the unwary for a song. Sherrif Cole made the arrest down in Old Town. Knowing that he had corralled a man of infinite jest he concluded to find out something further than he know of the man with Shakespearean talents. So the <em>Index</em> advertised to the world that those who had been caught in the net set, and so agreeable worked, by Mr. Corrigan, the gentleman of Italian extraction, could call at the Sherriff’s office and upon presentation of the diamond rings, alleged, would receive back their money, as the official held nearly $409 of the fakir’s coin.</p>
<p>“They began to be heard from yesterday. They had seen the <em>Index</em> article and they wanted back their coin. The chance was open.”</p>
<p>“Now, there is no man on earth who likes to be picked up for a sucker. Perish such a thought! Anything and everything can go, buy the sucker act – oh no! Everybody is too cunning to be classed in that category.</p>
<p>“When George Miller called on Sheriff Cole, presented the ring with a sheepish expression swinging around his countenance, and wanted the $2 he had put up, a titter swung around the circle that would had made glad the risibilities [sic] of Mark Twain. Then came Henry Cole, a brother of the Sherriff, who had put up $2.50. And soon after Eli Curtis waltzed in, carrying a sheepish look, and wanted $5. Bob Poppett next made his appearance and wanted $2.40 – all the change he happened to have. And finally Matthew Cleghorn strolled leisurely into the grinding shop. He wanted $10. He had been touched for two of the beautiful stones. He thought he had struck a bonanza in the way of diamonds, and wasn’t going to let any get away if he could help it.</p>
<p>“Did any of the above gentlemen get their money back? Not any. Would any of them swear to a complaint? Nary one. Are any of them suckers? Not if they know themselves. They are too cute. They would not go before a magistrate and say they had been roped in by a messly old tramp or any one else.</p>
<p>“The result of the whole business is that so far no complaint has been filed against Mr. Corrigan for obtaining money under false pretenses, and the probability is that none will be unless the Sheriff comes to the front and relates what he knows about the affable Mr. Corrigan.”</p>

<p>“The Fakir Came and Went, And Took Many Hard Earned Dollars, A Crowd of Populists and “Business Men” Done Up for a Large Amount,” –</p>
<p>Just tell them that you saw me. These were the parting words of a fakir Saturday afternoon as he drove away from the corner of Third and E streets. There was no necessity of his leaving any such advice with the crowd that had assembled, but it is doubtful whether or not the advice will be followed by man of them…</p>
<p>… The crowd was short about $200, but long on belts. A typical case was that of “Bob” Poppett of Warm creek, whose pockets fairly bulged. He stood a few moments, gave a few away to his friends and then with the rest of the crowd silently and sadly stole away, but the funny part of it all is that none of them will admit “that they saw him.”</p>

<p>“An Ideal Mountain Ranch, Nestling on the Side of Mount San Jacinto, A Trip Over the Mountain Road to A. B. McCrary’s Place – What it Produces,”</p>
<p>Idlewild, April 10., - (Special Correspondence of The Sun). – An invitation from my old time friend, Ab McCrary, to accompany him and party to his recently acquired ranch on San Jacinto mountain was readily accepted by me, as it would give me an opportunity of seeing something of farming in Southern California, at an altitude far removed from the home of the olive and the orange, and as I was so much charmed with all I saw I think it probable that an account of the trip might interest some of your readers. The time appointed for the start was 7:30 a.m. on Thursday, April 1, and at that hour I found three wagons loaded with young stock and a fourth, carrying camping outfit and provisions for the ranch, including certain medical comforts, to be used chiefly as an antidote for rattlesnake bites. We left Idlewild at the hour named, passed through Beaumont at 2 p.m. and camped at the foot of the mountain, on the ranch of Mr. Lawrence. Here the young calves were placed in the corral and horses, in the barn for the night.</p>
<p>Next morning four of the best horses were hitched to one wagon and the mountain climbing commenced, while two of the party, on foot, drove the stock before them. I rode beside E'. P. Lane, McCrary's uncle, who handled the ribbons, and his dexterity in driving over the stony road, up heavy grades and down steep declivities, excited both my wonder and astonishment till I learned that his occupation early in the ‘50s - &quot;The days of old, the days of gold” - Had been for years, driving stage over the mountains of Utah and Montana, making quick time conveying the U. S. mails behind six spanking horses every day. He proved on this occasion that his hand had not yet &quot;forgot its cunning.&quot;</p>
<p>Alter following the rough and stony road for four and a half miles, &quot;Elephant rock&quot; was reached. This consists of a monster boulder which, when the sun is in the right position, fairly represents the animal whose name it bears, but is of such mammoth proportions that had the late lamented Jumbo been placed by its side, he would have appeared but a pigmy in comparison.</p>
<p>Here, after working our way through the dreary wastes of underbrush, buck thorn and manzanita, with no animal life visible, except here and there a sleepy lizard basking on the warm side of a bare rock, the monotony of the scene was enlivened by the distant view of the green fields and pleasant homestead of the Poppett ranch down in the smiling valley beneath us, though it is situated at an elevation of 3,800 feet. It did not take us long to present ourselves at the hospitable door and receive hearty welcome. But time pressed so we passed through his green pastures, having to make something of a detour in conseque43nce of recent washouts, and pushed on up a rather steep grade, from the top of which we could look down on the pleasant valley, which comprises Ab McCrary’s mountain ranch. We estimated this as being somewhat higher up than the Poppett place, so call it 4,000 feet above sea level.</p>
<p>Down grade again for a couple of miles brought us to the ranch house, where we were heartily welcomed by Van Chipman, who is taking care of the place for McCrary for the present.</p>
<p>Here was to be seen an ideal mountain ranch, acres and acres of level meadow land, hedged on all sides by stately live oaks, the ground beneath which is literally covered with acorns, reminding me forcibly of “the husks that the swine did eat.” But what a place it would be to raise hogs! And only five miles from the railroad, and down grade all the way for the stock to travel. And then the water! So different from what we use in cities; cool, sparkling and bubbling from the fountainhead amongst the rocks, and so plentiful that it supplies the numerous brooks that meander through the plains, supplying the meadow grass with moisture and furnishing perpetual water for the stock, no matter how dry the season; then finding its way to the limits of the ranch and going to waster as it tumbles itself in miniature cascades amongst the rocks and crannies, soon losing itself amongst the sand and gravel in the numerous cafions.</p>
<p>What a pity to see so much waste, while in Banning, only five miles distant, they are being almost ruined for want of a water system such as could be supplied so close at home.</p>
<p>I could not help noticing the absence of anything in the shape of a washout, but found that all the storm water from the mountain is carried off into the cafions before it reaches the pleasant meadows of the ranch, and the torrents spend thie4r fury on the rugged rocks which act a natural harrier and protect the ranch from inundation.</p>
<p>Next day we proceeded to regular ranch work, and after branding the young stock &quot;J-P,&quot; conjoined, we proceeded to the house and &quot;branded&quot; every mother's son on the place.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on,&quot; says McCrary, who had been looking over my shoulder as I write; ' hold on there! I want the straight truth, so leave that out about branding the men.&quot;</p>
<p>But I reminded him that when he gave water to his horses, he told me he had &quot;watered&quot; them, and I claimed the same right to say when I had given brandy to the men that I had &quot;brandied&quot; them, and I still maintain the right.</p>
<p>The neglected peach and apple orchards show the possibilities in that direction, and I am informed that exceptionally fine melons, pumpkins, potatoes and other vegetables have been raised here, and altogether, in the hands of such a man as its present owner, it is safe to predict that in two or three years from now he will have a very beautiful mountain home.</p>
<p>All along the hills surrounding the flat land are evidences of prospecting camps, and at the mouths of the various drives much metal-hearing rock is scattered around, but of what character or value my inexperience in such matters prevents me from expressing an opinion, but specimens were brought to the city for expert examination.</p>
<p>George, the former owner of the ranch, accompanied us on this trip and rounded up a few of his horses, which had remained here all winter, and found them in good condition, although at times there were 22 inches of snow on the ground. The object of our visit being accomplished we made an early start next day and retraced our steps over the mountain road, arriving at Idlewild at 6 p. m. same day, after a most successful and pleasant outing with some excellent photographs of the most interesting incidents of the journey.</p>

<p>SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., April 28 – At the city election on April 12 returns from the Fourth Ward indicated the election of J. C. Wees (R.) over R. Poppett (F.) by a majority of two. The Democrats, Populists and Silver Republicans, forming a fusion party, decided to contest the election, alleging fraud on the part of the inspectors. The case came up today before Judge Oster, and a recount shows that Wees (Rep.) is elected by 1 majority.</p>

<p>Shortly after 2 p. m., yesterday, President Roberds called the attendance to order, and the minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved.</p>
<p>There were no sick reports and Pioneer Potter was present to speak for himself.</p>
<p>After the singing of the opening ode, Pioneer S. C. Cox proposed Robert Poppett for membership in the Society, and when the committee of investigation had acted, he was admitted by rising vote, and warmly congratulated upon his welcome advent to closer association with the organized '49ers.</p>
<p>Humorous clippings handed in by Sisters Earp, Yager, and Turley, were read by Assistant Secretary Stephen, who also renewed his motion in regard to the preservation of the giant sequoias. This was seconded by First Vice-President Holcomb, once a resident among them. After eloquent remarks from Pioneers Boren, Amos. Woodward, Brown and others the motion was unanimously carried, and much gratification expressed at the intention of Mrs. Hearst to donate liberally towards the expense of said preservation.</p>
<p>The Honorable Board of Supervisors was heartily commended for the steps being taken in the direction of providing a free road to the mountain summit, Pioneers Thomas, Brown and Stephen, especially expressing the gratefulness of the society for the long-desired movement.</p>
<p>Judge Knox, who fought alongside Lincoln and other notables in the Blackhawk war, said that he loved the men and women of '49, because they were of the Andrew Jackson type loyal to the people and their sacred Union of Republican States. His first vote was cast for the hero of New Orleans at Galena, Ill.</p>
<p>Col. Kelting. after long absence, was glad to lie again among his Argonautic associates, and remarked that be was failing physically, but would come to the meetings as often as possible.</p>
<p>Pioneer Bradford said that nothing cheered him up so much as a visit to Pioneer Hall, and hoped that his health would permit many more such exhilrants.</p>
<p>Pioneer Holcomb desired a large representation at the Episcopal church on the date selected. April 22, for the Rev. Brown's discourse to the Pioneers.</p>
<p>Prior to adjournment, Pioneer T. J. Wilson exhibited a rare specimen of cactus with a star-shaped bloom, which was symbolical of the Order of the Eastern Star. The cactus was referred to the floral committee for botanical diagnosis.</p>

<p>“Colonizing Scheme for Old Mexico,” –</p>
<p>There was a large gathering of a hundred or more people yesterday afternoon at the court room of Justice Thomas, that at first sight looked to be a meeting of the Socialist party but a few minutes listening through the wide open door showed that it was an Imperialistic-Expansion scheme and that the objective point was across the line in the sister republic of Mexico. Socialist N. A. Richardson appeared to be at the head of the move, with Democratic Deputy Sheriff W. C. Seccombe as right hand supporter and Republican C. B. Morris on his left, while an enthusiastic applauder of the remarks was Prohibitionist Williams. T. J. Wilson was on the platform, evidently to assist in furnishing the rolling stock for the move, and lawyers, mechanics, merchants, and business men of all classics were present, all eager to assist in the great work of colonizing and annexing the State of Sonora from Mexican rule, to that of the United States.</p>
<p>Sonora is said to be the richest and best farming land in the whole country across the line, while the climate is such that it puts even Southern California in the shade being especially noticeable for the great abundance of water. There is a tract of land there of 280,000 acres that can be obtained for a song and each one of the 100 men yesterday afternoon was tuning his pipes to assist in singing that song and ten times as many more citizens would like to help but they are to be kept in the dark until the first hundred have secured the land.</p>
<p>The meeting yesterday was the first one that has been held by the signers or stock holders in the plan. It is stated that tin tract of 280.000 acres can be bought for $20,000. One hundred men have been &quot;let in&quot; so that for $200 they become the owners of 2,800 acres when the lands are divided.</p>
<p>The land belongs to an estate, the heirs of which are said to reside in Arizona, and it is proposed first to buy in $15 each, making a fund of $1500, and with this a committee is to be sent out to prospect and report. It was for the purpose of electing this committee that the meeting was held yesterday afternoon. Policeman T. C.

<p>Pleased to hear from you, and to look upon real pressed flowers and leaves still holding their fragrance, and bringing vividly to mind the wonderful wealth of bloom of that charming southern land; also, of that never-to-be-forgotten excursion of 1890 when, coming from the Mojave desert, we were welcomed so heartily by the Pioneers of San Bernardino, and school children and citizens combined literally burying us In roses and plying us with good things to repletion. Hospitality was no name for it; it was an ovation. Mr. Clark and I often speak of it and the inspiration of that event abides with us, a bright spot in life's journey that time cannot efface.</p>
<p>&quot;You speak of having been made an honorary member of the San Bernardino Pioneer society. Please remember me kindly to them when you meet with them again.&quot;</p>

The others in the party were Bob Poppett and Mr. James. While on his way to camp last Friday noon Mr. Kleinhaus saw a line buck crossing Green valley. He had followed his trail down the mountain, probable having been scared by another hunter. Mr. Kleinhaus fired three shots at him as he ran through the brush, and one took effect. Bob Poppett, as the experienced trapper of the party, trailed the wounded buck till sundown without coming up with him. In the morning at 5 o'clock he took the trail again and his perseverance was rewarded after three hours of weary tramping, A less experienced trailer would have given up in despair. The buck weighed 150 pounds. Poppett and Cox did not return with the rest of the party, but stopped at Clark's ranch to fish for a couple of days.</p>

President Sheldon Stoddard being still confined to his hone with illness, Major D. A. Shaw, of Redlands, presided over the deliberations.</p>
<p>The petition of Lovina M. Van Curren for membership being reported favorably by Robert Poppett, C. L. Thomas and De La M.

Mrs. Van Curen was born in Iowa, August 15, 1847; started for California in 1851; crossed the plains with an ox team, and arrived in San Bernardino in 1854. She is a daughter of Jerome M. Benson, who died some years ago.</p>
<p>Secretary Brown read a letter from Hon. 0. Z. Hubbell, Senator at Sacramento, stating that his bill for a free mountain road had passed the Senate and, had been transmitted to the Assembly, where Major Prescott would push it along, and where it has passed and is ready for the governor’s signature. For several years the Pioneer Society has championed this free mountain road proposition. The benefits to be derived therefrom are numerous. The poor men will now be enabled to procure firewood that is now decaying and endangering the forests; the hard worked and poorly paid teamsters will now be able to haul the lumber from our mountain mills and earn a fair living for their families and teams; the tourists will be attracted in summer to our mountains in increased numbers from all parts of California. Realizing these and other advantages that will be derived from a free public road to our grand, inspiring mountains, it is no wonder that the Board of Trade, the Board of City Trustees, the Board of Supervisors, and many private citizens urged our Senator and Assemblyman Prescott, the Pioneer Society unanimously passed a vote of thanks to them for having unanimously passed a vole of thanks to them for having passed an Act so universally desired by the people of this county and this portion of the State.</p>
<p>A letter of acknowledgement from Hon. Albert K. Smiley was read, expressing appreciation of the tribute of respect passed by this Society in memory of the late Alfred K. Smiley.</p>
<p>Desiring to join with the citizens in beautifying the city, Pioneers Woodward, Holcomb, Brown, and Sister Sarah A. Yager were appointed an Arbor Day committee, to act for the Pioneers.</p>
<p>Little Miss Grace Lipari charmed the meeting with an appropriate recitation. Pioneer A. D. Shaw presented a historical incident in the life of John C. Fremont, showing the speed he made on horseback from Los Angeles to Sonoma, which will be read at next meeting, for which valuable historical contribution Major Shaw received the thanks of the meeting.

Recently Mr. Wixom has built an addition to his home and his friends decided to give him and Mrs. Wixom a house warming. And so they gathered last evening and paid them a visit. Mr. Wlxom had just taken a bath and retired. Then the door bell rang. Mrs. Wixom went to the door and she found assembled on the porch a score or more friends.

<p>“HIGHLAND,” June 20. – (Regular correspondence of THE SUN.) The funeral of <strong>Matthew Gleghor</strong>, who died at his home here Thursday night, took place at 2 o’clock this afternoon from the family residence. It was one of the most largely attended funerals ever known in this vicinity, evincing the esteem in which the aged man was held by friends, not only of this section, but from all parts of the country. The procession, which wended its way from the home, where the services were held, to San Bernardino, interment being in the city cemetery there, was over a mile long. At the home, which is of more than ordinary size, three-fourths of the people, who had come to pay their last respects, were unable to find even standing room in the parlors where lay the casket, wreathed in flowers. The services were conducted by Rev. j. R. Shie, of the Christian church in San Bernardino, and a choir from his congregation rendered music at the home and grave side.</p>
<p>The floral tributes were especially notable, considering that the season of the year has come when bloom is scarce. Despite this fact a great number of designs were brought by friends of the family. These were mostly in carnations and roses, while sweet peas formed the body ofseveral of the most beautiful of the set pieces. The pall bearers were:</p>

Miss Maymie Holcomb, the worthy and efficient teacher of Warm-Springs school, then introduced several of her pupils who recited and sang patriotic and lob cabin songs, &quot;The Star Spangled Banner,&quot; &quot;The Red, White and Blue,&quot; &quot;The Old Oaken Bucket&quot; being among the selections, all of which were rendered with more than ordinary fervor, and enthusiasm, and most heartily applauded.

He congratulated the pioneers on the completion of their most excellent exhibit, the log cabin, on behalf of-the whole Festival committee, and expressed the opinion that it would certainly be one of the features of the Festival, and was gratified to note the energy and sprightliness exhibited by men passed 70 and 80 years of age, in contemplating the heavy work required in ascending the mountains, chopping the pine trees down, trimming and preparing them and the clapboards for the cabin, doing their own cooking, suffering a snow storm in the mountains, camping In a barn, then putting up the heavy logs and finishing the new structure, including the roof, doors and window, without using any nails, only wooden pegs, was certainly a wonder for the people of the present generation to contemplate. The pioneers were so delighted with the eulogistic remarks of Chairman Cooley that he received a unanimous and rousing vote of thanks.</p>
<p>Sister Eva T. Bussenlus, Past Grand President of the Native Daughters of the Golden West, a welcome visitor from Los Angeles, responded to urgent calls and eloquently expressed her attachment to the Pioneers and to the vigorous society she finds existing and flourishing in San Bernardino, and for proof of her devotion recalled the fact that she and Mrs. Lettie Woodward Keli had gone to the mountains and aided the pioneer committee in chopping down the pine trees, an undertaking that will never be forgotten.</p>

<p>“Has Record As An Aged Climber, Egbert lngersoll, Eighty-Five Years of Age, Does Stunts on San Jacinto that Would Bother Younger People.” –</p>
<p>Egbert lngersoll, father of Joseph lngersoll, of this city, probably has he local record for octogenarians. In company with a party of hunters, Mr. lngersoll returned yesterday from a week's camping trip on Mt. San Jacinto, where he slept on the ground for a week, climbed to the summit of the south peak, an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet, and topped off his trip by riding down the mountain from Fuller's mill to Banning on horseback. Mr. lngersoll is within a week of his eighty-fifth birthdav, and the members of his party declare they do not believe any other man of his years has done what Mr. lngersoll has just accomplished.</p>
<p>A week ago a party made up of Joseph lngersoll and his father, Egbert lngersoll, of Los Angeles; Robert Poppett, John Poppett, Chris. Jensen and Hal Rodden left the city, going out to Banning in the 'former's automobile, and there a pack outfit was made up, four of the members of the party going in a light wagon and two on horseback, and they headed up the grade for Fuller's mill, where they were to camp. They spent a week on the mountain, and among other things, Mr. Ingersoll climbed the peak, but neither the altitude nor the exertion affected him, notwithstanding his 85 years.</p>
<p>Coming down Thursday, he and Robert Poppett made the 21-mlle trip to Banning on horseback, and Mr. lngersoll was as active and fresh as any member of the party when they arrived at Banning. Only one deer was brought in by the hunters, the buck falling to a shot from Hal Rodden's rifle. The altitude at Fuller's mill, where they camped, is 6,500 feet.</p>

<p>THE PIONEER.</p>
<p>&quot;What was his name? I do not know his name;</p>
<p>I only know he heard God's voice and came;</p>
<p>Brought all he loved across the sea,</p>
<p>To live and work for God and me;</p>
<p>Felled the ungracious oak,</p>
<p>Dragged from the soil,</p>
<p>With torrid toll,</p>
<p>Thrice-gnarled roots and stubborn rock,</p>
<p>With plenty piled the haggard mountain side,</p>
<p>And at the end, without memorial, died;</p>
<p>No blaring trumpet sounded out his fame;</p>
<p>He lived, he died; I do not know his name.</p>
<p>No form of bronze and no memorial stones Show me the place where lie his mouldering bones;</p>
<p>Only a cheerful city stands,</p>
<p>Built by his hardened hands;</p>
<p>Only ten thousand homes</p>
<p>Where every day</p>
<p>The cheerful play</p>
<p>Of love and hope and courage comes.</p>
<p>These are his monuments, and these alone;</p>
<p>There is no form of bronze and no memorial stone.&quot;</p>

<p>The Pioneers, instead of gathering at their usual place of meeting, Native Sons' hall, Third street, assembled as a body and In large numbers at the corner of D and Seventh streets, in this city, at 2 o'clock p. m., to join with, the many neighbors and friends in paying the last honors to the remains of our late venerble and highly esteemed pioneer, brother <strong>Jerry McElvaine</strong>, who passed on from his earthly home so quietly, so peacefully, so suddenly, without sickness, without pain, without warning, while in his home in the enjoyment of social amusement with his wife and children, Thursday evening at 8:30 o'clock. Which sudden visitation causes a shock to the whole community as our late brother was seen on the street and at his home late in the afternoon In apparently good health and his neighbors and friends would not entertain the idea that he had passed away from earthly scenes until the particulars were ascertained from the members of the family as Indicated above.</p>
<p>Brother Jerry McElvaine was born In Kalamazoo, Michigan, November 21, 1829; at 11 years of age his father, Jeremiah, Sr.. died, from that on he had to earn his own living. When 20 years of age he crossed the plains with 150 emigrants, driving ox teams, reaching Sacramento, California, in the spring of 1859, shortly after coming to San Bernardino to live, and returning to Stockton and Sonora and Mariposa, where he was engaged in freighting, but soon returned to San Bernardino, where he lived until his death. In 1859 he married Miss Minerva Morse; engaged In teaming and freighting to Salt Lake and as far as Montana. In later years he has lived a quiet, simple life, beloved by all his neighbors and friends who will miss his genial face as. he was so well known In this community. On November 5 last, the whole community took a deep Interest In the golden wedding of this worthy couple, celebrated at their home surrounded by all their children and numerous friends, none of whom seemed to enjoy this delightful occasion more than this venerable pioneer husband and father.</p>
<p>On November 21 he reached and celebrated his eightieth year with his family, and seemed to be in fair health and bright spirits. His time seemed to come when enjoying the sweet comforts of home in the midst of his family, without pain, without sorrows, without sickness, without anxiety, perfectly resigned to the will of his Heavenly Father. The most devout Christian Could not ask for a happier termination of earth life than this was, and our fondest wish should be that our last end should be as his was.</p>
<p>Besides his beloved widow, he leaves five sons. William A. McEIvaine, Jefferson C. McElvaine. a member 6f the State Board of Equilization; Frank E. McElvaine, Charles McElvaine, Mrs. Janey Knapp, all of this city, and John C. McElvaine. of Coalinga, Fresno county; all highly esteemed citizens to honor and revere the memory of a kind and indulgent father.</p>

<p>“The Pioneers,” - SHORTLY after 2 p. m. yesterday at Native Sons' hall, President George Miller, after requesting Sister Wallace and Brother Stoddard to occupy the vacant chairs beside him, called the fair attendance of members and friends to order, and the opening ode, was sung to the piano, violin and concertina accompaniment furnished by Sister Case, and Brothers Roberds and Stephen.</p>
<p>The following intimations were made as to condition of sick associates: Sister Mary Clyde is no better; Sister Yount is able to be out; Brother Smithson and daughter, Mrs. Nellie Patterson, are a good deal stronger; Sister Hardin Yager, still feeble; and the wants of Sister Walters will be supplied by the Honorable Board of Supervisors.</p>
<p>The secretary read a postal just received by Sister Louisa Waters from Mrs. Canterbury, of Redlands, which stated that her venerated mother, Sister Robbins-Crafts, was. not yet out of danger, but sent to the society her best wishes for spiritual as well as material advancement.</p>
<p>The application of Mrs. Caroline M. Craw-Woodward of San Bernardino, for admission to active membership in the society having, been endorsed by Sisters Alexander, Case and Dodson, the committee of Investigation, that respected lady was warmly welcomed to the ranks of the county argonauts. Sister Woodward was born at Springville, Utah, on January 15, 1852, and came to California in 1859.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hattie Kennedy, of Searchlight. Nevada, a granddaughter of James Henry Rollins, a merchant of the Old Fort period, and Mrs. Ida Carter Hitsman of San Bernardino, were introduced, by Sister Simpson as helpers, entitled to active membership, in the society, and on motion were admitted by unanimous vote! Robert E. Bledsoe of San Bernardino for many years a warm admirer of the argonauts, and a most, welcome visitor at their meetings, having expressed a desire, or rather been earnestly requested, to become an active member of the society, on motion of Sister Godfrey, seconded by Brother Robert Poppett, Mother Kissee, and others, that well-deserved honor was rousingly conferred. The popular attorney fittingly and eloquently responded, holding, as he ever does, the Pioneers in high estimation, not only because his wife's mother, the late Mrs. Bottoms, was a venerated member, but for their priceless labors before and since the birth of the society. The president announced the appointment of Brothers Stoddard, Holcomb Waite, Woodward and Brown, and Sisters Alexander and Smithson, as a Centennial Celebration committee, to confer with the Native Sons and Daughters, and other organizations.</p>
<p>On motion of Past President Roberds, the sympathy of the society was extended to the sorrowing relatives, of Sister Nancy Grimes, recently deceased.</p>
<p>A humorous clipping was read by Sister Miller and little Miss Janette McMulIen sang delightfully.</p>
<p>On motion , by Brother Holcomb, Gustavus Stromee, of San Bernardino, formerly a member of the Los Angeles Pioneer Society, was made an honorary member of the San Bernardino Society of California Pioneers.</p>
<p>Bronze grizzly bears of unique design were presented to President Miller and Treasurer Holcomb for faithful services during the past year in their respective offices, to which they have been unanimously re-elected.</p>
<p>Brother Stoddard presented to the society the cattle-brand used by the first owners of the Rancho San Bernardino, and Brother Hancock contributed a spoke from one of the wagon wheels which enabled him to cross the plains in the &quot;Days of Old.&quot;</p>
<p>The secretary entertainingly told of the visit of the pioneer delegation Brothers Stoddard, Holcomb, Brown, and Stephen to the public school In Mission district, where they Occupied the auditorium platform for an hour or two in the presence of the expectant scholars, their fathers and mothers and their careful teachers. Professor Latham, Miss Anna Fine and Miss Elizabeth Holcomb. Prof. Latham having consented to preside, called on in Secretary Brown to give the history of the first settlement of San Bernardino valley, with especial reference to the labors of the fathers and mothers of Mission district, some of whom graced the assemblage.</p>
<p>Quite a number of pertinent pioneer curios were on exhibition, including the first rancho cattle brand, and a sword which belonged to the chief caballero and land owner of this valley. At the conclusion of Brother Brown's address, which was especially interesting to the aged members of the Van Leuven, Curtis, Wilson, Jackson, Horton, Bermudes, and other long-settled families, Brother Stoddard and Holcomb were introduced as primal pioneers of surpassing skill and fortitude, and Brother Stephen as chief poet and comedian of the brave Men and Women, of '49 and the early fifties.</p>
<p>Eleven pretty children sang sweetly to the piano accompaniment of Miss Fine, who similarly aided the rendition of an affecting number by eight winsome young ladies. At the conclusion of the exercises, a vote of thanks was awarded to the visiting pioneers, and to Automobilist Yount, a son of Sister Yount, for his kindness in bringing them to and taking them back from the capacious and elegant school house of Mission district.</p>
<p>President Miller having reminded those present that the anniversary of the society would soon occur, the following letter from the Society of California Pioneers of New England was read and ordered spread in full upon the minutes:</p>
<p>John Brown, Jr., Esq., Secretary San Bernardino Society California Pioneers,</p>
<p>Dear Comrade and Brother Pioneer: Your very kind and flattering letter was duly received and read to the &quot;boys&quot; on our last meeting day, January 1, 1910. It was enthusiastically received, especially by those present who were on that memorable excursion In 1890 to your part of the country, and especially to your city, as you were the first to take us by the hand and bid us welcome. It was a great day, and one that will never be forgotten by us while we live. Not half of that party are alive today. We had five at our last meeting one died the night before and two others passed away within three weeks past. The occasion is referred to at every meeting, and you In particular are remembered by all. John Brown. Jr. is as familiar to us as George Washington is to the Nation. Long may you live.</p>
<p>I was directed to answer your kind letter with the thanks of the entire society, and that you may all live to see many Merry Christmases and Happy New Years, and that prosperity may follow all of your members to the end of this earthly life and at last find a place in that Heavenly home that is promised us.</p>
<p>Our members are dropping out rapidly, as a majority have passed the four-score years, with five others who are on the ninetieth mark.</p>
<p>You have the younger members to keep up the organization, while we have not - the sons here take no interest in it. The attendance at our meetings shows that we are on the downward track, not so much of lost interest as of infirmities of old age and distances, as our boys are scattered all over New England.</p>
<p>Brother Mitchell, who has visited you many times from Bryn Mawr, in winters past, is laid up at his home in Campello, and will probably never meet with us again. He has diabetes.</p>
<p>Now may the blessings of Heaven rest with you all for all time.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours, STEPHEN W. FOSTER, Secretary. Boston, Jan. 3, 1910.</p>
<p>After passing a vote of thanks to the ever-mindful Eastern Argonauts, who revisited the Pacific Coast a number of years ago, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>“Former Utah Man is Amazed at Prosperity, Robert Poppett Tells Neighbors at San Bernardino Something About Growth of Beehive State,” –</p>
<p>Robert Poppett, one of the oldest residents of San Bernardino valley, having come out to this section from Utah in 1854, returned this week from a visit to his boyhood haunts in Utah. Yesterday Mr. Poppett paid the Free Press a pleasant visit and told something of his trip, says the San Bernardino (Cal.) Free Press.</p>
<p>He, in company with his daughter, Miss Leah Poppett, and Mrs. Allie Benson, spent two months in the Mormon state. They toured the state from Springville to Ogden, stopping at the former city, Park City, Provo, Pleasant Grove, Fountain Green and Salt Lake. They spent two weeks in the capital city and visited all points of interest there, including the famous tabernacle. Mr. Poppett says there is enough water wasted annually in Salt Lake to irrigate a large portion of the San Bernardino valley.</p>
<p>He is very enthusiastic over the outlook, present conditions and fertility of Utah lands, and reports splendid crops of berries and fruits of all natures, save citrus fruits.</p>
<p>He says the lands that could be bought when he was a boy at $1 an acre are selling for $200 to $800 now, and that raw land in Utah is as high as raw land here.</p>
<p>He reports a pleasant visit among his old friends and says the prosperity and richness of Utah was a revelation to him.</p>

<p>“The Pioneers,” - The Pioneers met In Native Sons hall yesterday under rather unfavorable conditions as both President Miller and Secretary Brown were absent, which of course left us in something of a dilemma, but Past President Woodward occupied President Miller's chair and after making a few appropriate remarks and congratulating the assemblage called Brother Printz and Mother Yount to seats of honor as his supporters, and called the meeting to order and the routine business was carried on by calling roll of officers, reading and approval of the minutes of the previous meeting, etc.</p>
<p>Sick reports were quite favorable, Brother Tittle improving and quite cheerful; Mrs. Hansen much better and Mother Stuchberry and Brother C. L. Thomas were present and feeling real well.</p>
<p>The tragic and deplorable death of our highly esteemed fellow citizen. Col. W. L. Vestal, was announced, and many kind words were spoken of him by his sorrowing friends and after many eulogistic remarks by Thomas Woodward Holcomb and several others, on motion of Rev. M. B. Shaw and seconded by Mother Kissee and many others, the sympathy of the society was extended to his bereaved widow and his many sorrowing friends.</p>
<p>The committee on celebration of Admission day made a partial report, very satisfactory, and were continued, and treasurer ready to pay all demands.</p>
<p>Mrs. Canterberry presented the society with a goodly number of printed sermons by the Rev. J. H. Williams at the funeral of our dearly beloved Mother Crafts, and received thanks for the same.</p>
<p>Under good of the society many pleasing anecdotes were told and were much enjoyed.</p>
<p>This being the seventy-ninth birthday of Mrs. L. M. Woods, President Woodward declared a short recess in order to congratulate her on the happy event, and a real social time was enjoyed for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Brother and Sister Case gave us some delightful vocal music with piano accompaniments; Brothers Thomas, Shaw, Sister Case and others telling many amusing anecdotes to the great edification of the audience.</p>
<p>Brother Robert Poppett told of his recent visit to Utah, where he met many of his old friends, none of whom had forgotten their old-time hospitality. He was much delighted with the beautiful and well governed city of Salt Lake. Sister McElvain also related her recent trip to Utah, visiting old friends there, but was glad to get back to old San Bernardino.</p>
<p>Brother Bledsoe amused us with some of his humorous jokes and so ended our pleasing exercises, and as the circus will be here next Saturday, the meeting, after the benediction by Rev. M. B. Shaw, adjourned to Saturday, October 1.</p>

<p>“The Pioneer,” – The pioneers seem to live the sentiment of the poet when he says “When but few years of life remain, ‘tis life renewed to laugh them o’er again”.</p>
<p>For they feel inspired by the retrospect of a long and useful life, a retrospect that brings to them hope and satisfaction and a resignation to the will of Him who doeth all things well. The meeting of yesterday In Native Sons' hall proved no exception to the former gatherings for smiling countenances and buoyancy of spirits. President George Miller was never in a happier mood and called Sister Susan Heath and Brother Printz as supporters, thanked Sisters Alexander and Crandall for beautiful bouquets and congratulated the members on the lively and interesting reunions of lifelong friends, more appreciated by those whose ties of friendship have been cemented for over half a century and the many vicissitudes of life have made stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>After roll call and reading of the minutes. Sister Stuchberry was reported still confined to her home, but hopeful for a speedy recovery from her protracted illness. Brother W. S. Tittle has improved so that he was able to attend to business. Sisters Case, Crandall and Yager submitted a glowing report of the golden wedding celebrated at last meeting in which our venerable pioneers, Brother and Sister W. F. Holcomb were the chief participant, as bride and groom of 50 years ago, being in faith health, surrounded by a happy family of sons and daughters, and a large circle of grandchildren to cheer Grandma and Grandpa on their way to the diamond wedding day, a fond wish also entertained for them by their hundreds of friends all over Southern California, and especially by all their admiring neighbors by whom they have lived for many years.</p>
<p>These golden weddings are quite an attraction among the Pioneers. Brother and Sister R. T. Roberds celebrated theirs not long ago. Brother and Sister McElvain commemorated theirs early in the: year and soon thereafter Brother Jerry McElvain was called away to his heavenly home.</p>
<p>President Miller noticing: Messrs. L. Espelin, George H. Romrell and D. R. Taylor in the audience, extended a cordial welcome to them and invited them to address the society. Each responded with a message of good cheer and appreciation of the noble work of the Pioneers, indulging in the hope that the last days of the Pioneers may be the most delightful and implored our Heavenly Father to grant these blessings.</p>
<p>Past President Woodward by request reviewed the history of the Argonauts, classed them with empire builders, referred to the superhuman courage required to leave happy homes to venture into an unknown wilderness with dangers on every hand to establish on Pacific's shore a civilization that is now the admiration of the United States and the whole world. The proudest monuments of the pioneers he claimed to be the Native Daughters and the Native Sons of the Golden West.</p>
<p>Past President R. T. Roberds was prevailed on to recount some of his experiences in crossing the plains, and after some persuasion favored the society with of the most comprehensive recitals of pioneering that he ever ventured to give to his sisters and brothers. He began in the Rocky mountains near Fort Pueblo, where Secretary Brown was born, where he became acquainted with the trappers and mountaineers James W. Waters, John Brown. Sr., V. J. Herring, Kit Carson and others then started west, crossing the dangerous Green river, stopping at Salt Lake, then on past the Humboldt, Carsonn valley, Hangtown and Sutter's Fort, coming all the way with ox team suffering at times for provisions, living on hominy and milk from the faithful cows that were frequently worked by the side of the oxen. For three days he lived on wild rose berries, all of which if written just as it happened would make an interesting volume for the present and future generations to read and learn to appreciate the true worth and heroism of those who with the rifle and the axe cleared the way for western civilization.</p>
<p>Past President W. F. Holcomb by earnest solicitation, favored the society with some of his experiences in crossing the plains in 1850. He lost all his provisions and clothing in trying to cross Green river, walked most of the way barefooted across the American continent to Hangtown where he began mining with varied experiences. President Miller responded briefly, the meeting taking the form of an experience revival, proving of unusual interest. He was followed by Brother Robert Poppett with pleasant remarks.</p>
<p>Sisters Louisa Waters and Susanna Rathbun contributed cheerful and encouraging thoughts and the members were delightful to see them present and participate in the joyous occasion.</p>
<p>Master Willie Leffin. grandson of Sister Susan M. Heath, favored the meeting with a lovely vocal selection entitled &quot;The Shoemaker.&quot; The pioneer favorites, Brother and Sister John Case had their son Leslie with them and delighted the audience with choice vocal numbers, with Sister Case accompanying on the piano. Master Lewis showed much careful training and promises to be a star in the musical world. Good Mothers Kissee. Roberds. Case, Cleghorn, with Van Dorin, Hudson and others expressed gratification on being present at such a harmonious reunion, where one is thrilled with the loving friendship that has been tried as through the fire and retort of time and can fully appreciate the sentiment of the poet:</p>
<p>&quot;And should affection shed one tear, and memory linger around my tomb, The tribute will be doubly dear. If coming from those of home, sweet home.&quot;</p>

<p>“Pioneers,” - The Pioneers gathered in the Log Cabin yesterday afternoon to enjoy another meeting before adjournment for the summer months. Pres. George Miller presided, with, Sister Kate Luning and Bishop John Hunt of Utah as supporters.</p>
<p>The roll was called and the minutes read by Sister Rose Crandall Wilson, in the unexpected but unavoidable absence of Brother John Brown, Jr.</p>
<p>Rev. M. B. Shaw invoked the Divine blessing on the meeting.</p>
<p>Reports from the sick were of a cheerful nature. Sister Luning able to be out after several months ill health. Brother Tom Roberts Improving and sending kind wishes to all his old friends. Sister Kissee holding her own.</p>
<p>Among the argonauts present were Sheldon Stoddard, Robert Poppett, George I. Burton, De La M. Woodward, Samuel Rolfe, Robert Bledsoe, Brother Printz. The following letter from our beloved secretary, John Brown, Jr., was read and ordered on the minutes; with our appreciation of his thoughtfulness and also our regret over his absence.</p>
<p>San Bernardino, Calif., July 13th, 1912.</p>
<p>To President George Miller, and to the members of the Pioneer Society:</p>
<p>Dear Sisters and Brothers: I regret very much, more than I am able to express to you by inability to be with you at this, the last meeting before our summer vacation. I had planned to make a brief report to you of my trip to Albuquerque, New Mexico, near Santa Fe, Taos, Pueblo, Colorado, the country of the trappers and hunters of the Rocky Mountains: Kit Carson, Fremont, Williams, Waters, Herring, and you will pardon me for naming Brown among them. Brave souls who braved the dangers of the wilderness of mountains, plains and deserts to open the way for Western civilization.</p>
<p>I wished also to assure you how well your minutes and proceedings read to us at Albuquerque and at the Grand Canyon so faithfully kept by our good Sisters Waters and Wilson.</p>
<p>I wished also to report the most enjoyable time Mrs. Brown and I enjoyed at the home of our daughter, Mrs. C. H. Wiggett at Albuquerque, during our three weeks' visit with them and the celebration of our 36th wedding anniversary, July 4th, at a family re-union.</p>
<p>Then our visit of four days at the Grand Canyon, that wonder of wonders, spell binding and awe-inspiring work of our Heavenly Father, which we visited on our way home, and only wished that you all could stand by our side and enjoy this grand, magnificent, sublime scene.</p>
<p>I am denied the pleasure of communing with you this day in our dear little Log Cabin, by two urgent telegrams calling me to the desert at Palm Springs on important professional business. I have the books all prepared to date and will notify our dear Sister Rose Crandall Wilson, so she will serve you at this meeting along with Sister Waters if her home duties permit her to attend.</p>
<p>So have a good meeting and, in closing it, I recommend that the best wishes of the Society be extended to all the sick and to all the Sisters and Brothers that they may all enjoy a happy vacation in the mountains, at the sea shore, or at home, wherever they may desire, and that we may all meet again September 7th, strengthened and ready to go on with the good work of the Pioneers on Admission Day, is the wish of your old secretary.</p>
<p>JOHN BROWN, Jr.</p>
<p>Reports were made of the way the Fourth of July was celebrated. The majority of the members spent the day at Meadowbrook Park, where plenty of shade and the sound of running water, made an ideal spot for the Pioneers to enjoy together a quiet old-fashioned holiday. The baskets were well-filled, the coffee excellent and the good cheer unbounded. Sister Godfrey reported the bills all paid and twenty-five cents on hand toward the Admission Day fund. Brother and Sister Chipman had an enjoyable outing in the mountains, and celebrated the Fourth with Brother Wm. Stephens.</p>
<p>Brother John Hunt of Utah brought greetings to the Pioneers. On a previous visit he was admitted to membership, and it was a great pleasure to all to welcome him to their meeting again. He spoke briefly of his membership in the Pioneer Society of Pueblo, Colorado, he having entered that state in 1848. Soon after that he traveled to Utah, so he claims membership in the Pioneer Society of that State also. In 1847 he visited California in company with his father, Capt. Jefferson Hunt, and others, and in 1851 moved to California, his marriage taking place in San Bernardino, July 4th, 1857.</p>
<p>Sister Minerva McElvaine told of a delightful four weeks’ outing at the beach resorts and Santa Ana, and brought kind greeting from Sister Neill.</p>
<p>Brother Woodward handed in a clipping calling the Descendants of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence to prove their claims to membership In that Society in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Brother M. B. Shaw related an amusing bear story. Sister Sarah Yager, who leaves in the morning for her camp at Mormon Springs, promised to heed the moral of the bear story. Sister Harrison reported the success of the surprise birthday which was carried out at the Log Cabin last Sunday afternoon. She thanked the pioneers and friends for this notable celebration, the kind wishes, the loving gift and the congratulations that came to her. A beautiful little great granddaughter sprinkled flowers in her path as she walked forward to cut the birthday cake surrounded by seventy-six candles.</p>
<p>On motion, good wishes were extended to all the brothers and sisters for a pleasant and profitable vacation.</p>
<p>Adjournment was made until September 7, in Native Sons’ Hall.</p>

<p>“Oldest Hunter is Off for the Hills, Has Same Steady Tread of Half a Century Ago When He Made First Hunt,” –</p>
<p>With as steady a tread as half a century ago, when he made his first deer hunting trip in the San Bernardino mountains, Robert Poppett, pioneer of the city, is off today to open the deer season on the desert slope of the range and be believes he will come back with another pair of antlers to add to his record of many score.</p>
<p>Mr. Poppett is in his seventy-third year and will probably be the oldest deer hunter in the mountains this season. With him on this trip will be John and Edward Poppett, his two sons, and Frank and George Rathbun. They will go out through the Bear Valley country to the desert side, believing that the small army of hunters who plan on hunting in Big Bear will drive the dee over onto the desert side.</p>

<p>Snow fell during the night they laid over at Clark's ranch, and the fall was heavy. Not in years has snow got down as low as Clark's this early in the winter.

<p>“Pioneers,” - The Pioneers were in an unusually, happy mood yesterday at their regular meeting in the Native Sons' hall, caused not only by the profusion of beautiful flowers, but by the recollection of the joyous May day celebration enjoyed on Thursday last, participated in by many families, who originated this inspiring custom in the first settlement of San Bernardino, over half a century ago.</p>
<p>President Silas C. Cox, in assuming his duties, called Sister Jane Smithson and Brother Robert Poppett as supporters, and thanked Sisters Alexander, Wallace, Crandall and Mrs. Charles Boehm and Miss Alice Durbin for the charming floral display before him.</p>
<p>Our good Mother Yount was reported holding her own with true pioneer courage; Miss Harris convalescent; Sister Bertha Miller ailing a little; Sister Josie Chipman not quite able to attend the meeting; Brother C. L. Thomas reported confined at the home of his daughter, near G and Third streets, by illness, which news was a surprise to his sisters and brothers. On motion of Brother Woodward, good cheer and best wishes for speedy recovery were sent to him and all the sick and feeble.</p>
<p>Sister Mary A. Crandall, chairman of the May day celebration on Thursday, submitted an interesting report of the enjoyable celebration in the city pavilion, when Mother Mary E. Wood, of Colton, was crowned queen of May by Brother R. T. Roberds, and little Miss Catherine Ray, a pupil of the second grade of the F street school, taught by Misa Avis Holcomb, was crowned as the juvenile queen of May, thus recognizing the passing and the coming generations.</p>
<p>The report recommends that a hearty vote of thanks be extended to the honorable mayor and members of the common council for the free use of the pavilion; to Mr. Starr, of company K. N. G. C., for the use of the piano; to those talented musicians, Messrs. Stevens, Brush and Whiteman, for inspiring music; to Brother and Sister Barker, who worked so faithfully to make the day such a grand success; to Miss Avis Holcomb, for the Juvenile queen feature of the coronation, and for choruses by her pupils; to Uncle Joseph Hancock, now 91 years of age, for revolutionary airs on his flute, used by him for the past 75 years; to the charming favorite of the Pioneers, little Miss Wilda Varley, only 6 years of age, and to Brother and Sister Case, for old time home songs that never die. This report and recommendations were unanimously adopted.</p>
<p>Brother Sheldon Stoddard reported that the guard railing around the monument recently constructed on the Santa Fe and Salt Lake trail, had been placed in good shape and form by the monument committee, who obtained the valuable assistance of Brothers George M. Cooley and Frank Cooley, under whose special supervision this work was done. The committee was taken to the monument by Brother George M. Cooley in one of his auto trucks, and besides the labor performed, an enjoyable outing was spent by every member of the committee. The monument is now ready for dedication, and at next meeting the time will be set for such ceremony.</p>
<p>The dispatch from Kansas City was read stating that the &quot;Old Trails National Road&quot; convention had selected the route westward through Albuquerque, Needles, Barstow, San Bernardino and Los Angeles, generally the Santa Fe trail, on which the pioneer monument has just been constructed, gives much pleasure to the Pioneers. On motion of Brother D. L. Aldridge a vote of thanks was extended to our energetic Native Sons, Messrs. Ralph E. Swing, M. C. McKenney, and to George N. Haven, of THE SUN force, for their untiring energies in securing for us so great a victory.</p>
<p>A number of Pioneers expressed much satisfaction in attending the high school oratorical contest on Friday evening, under the supervision of that enthusiastic Native Son, Professor Goodcell, when the glories of California, from different view points, were proclaimed by the bright scholars of the high school, who were striving to secure the medals offered by our Native Sons, who are to be commended for this laudable undertaking in inspiring the rising generation to study the glorious state in which they live. Our worthy Native Son, J. W. Curtis, was one of the judges on this occasion, and awarded the medals to the successful orators in a satisfactory manner.</p>
<p><strong>New Members.</strong> Mrs. Minnie Elizabeth Boehm and Mrs. Jessie Curtis Case were admitted as members. Sister Boehm was born in San Francisco and Sister Case in San Bernardino, both Native Daughters of the Golden West, who expressed pleasure in joining the Pioneer circle, where such good times are enjoyed, and so much good is being done, especially to the good old mothers and fathers, who deserve more attention and devotion than is too infrequently their portion.</p>
<p>Brother M. B. Shaw pronounced the benediction, when another lovable reunion was declared closed.</p>

<p>“Pioneers,” - The station of President Cox was decorated with beautiful flowers furnished by Sisters Barker and Alexander at the lively meeting yesterday in Native Sons' hall, Sisters Evans and Zimmerman acting as supporters to the president. The opening roll was sung with the usual enthusiasm, Past President R. T. Roberds leading with his pioneer violin with his old-time vigor and skill. Impressive invocations by Brother M. B.

He, with others have been lonesome since the departure of that much beloved pioneer, Brother Wtn. F. Holcomb, who always extended good cheer wherever he went. Mother Crandall, chairman of the Fourth of July celebration, announced the following committees:</p></li>

</ul>
<p>On motion of Pioneer Aldridge, Brothers George Miller and Frank Barter were appointed a committee to go to the Knapp ranch and select and Ibloze the trees required for such addition. Brother Shaw, on behalf of the Clirlstion church of this city, corner of Seventh and E streets, extended an invitation to attend patriotic services on this Sunday evening at 7:45 p. m., and that Company K will be present, which Invitation was promptly and cheerfully accepted. - Brother Miller jrouched! for the new scheme of hatch'lng geese, ducks and chickens with warm water and that such new method of incubation has been demonstrated In Highland with perfect success, the water running over the eggs at a proper temperature the usual length of time will bring ail the goslings, ducklings and chicks every time. . The. sensational report concerning the finding of a skeleton and two pots of gold on the Tyler place In this city was brought up for discussion by the pioneers. Brothers iAldridge and Cox and Sister Woodward reported having gone to the place for investigation and stated what they saw of the vault and skeleton. Various theories were then advanced, all Interesting, but still theories, that an ancient Indian burying ground extended all along the bluff on lower C, D and B streets was condeder toy Sisters 'Woodward, Boehm, Smithson and Brothers Thomas Miller, Brown, Aldridge, Boren and others, and the skeleton found could easily be that of an Indian from this old Indian cemetery. Brother Thomas, Miller and Brown stated that they were present and attended Indian funerals along this bluff, but, as to the vault, that remains a mystery. Brother Thomas thought It was a contrivance of Mr. U. U. Tyler, the pioneer butcher, for piaWng lard and melting tallow. Brother Cox thought it was an old sweat house used by the Indians, which they would spring from into the brook close by for curative purposes. Sister Woodward thought that the vault as found was a receptacle for valued treasure used by the rich don In the early Wu. Brother Aldrldge was Inclined to favor this view, as there were no banks in those days to stow away treasures, 80 the matter was left undetermined. ' &quot;</p>
<p>Brother Monte Week's read an original poem on the San Bernardino mountains, eliciting much applause and encouragement. Mother Woods of Colton, ill,. Queen of May, extended an invitation to the pioneers to be with her at an &quot;At Home&quot; on July HO all day, which was gladly accepted. Her home Is at 1S3 West G street. Have the car stop at the Colton city library, then go west one Mock and on the north side of the street. Our good mother will be at the gate to receive you. Brother George Wixom invoked benediction.</p>

<p><strong>A New Legend</strong> - The following new legend of the Arrowhead was read, and created much interest and amusement:</p>
<p>Many, many years ago the Serrano indians, a branch of the Coahuilla Mission Indians of Southern California, established a large rancheria or village on the flat where the hot springs are, a little north and east of the present site of the famous Arrowhead hotel, at the base of what is now known as Arrowhead mountain, attracted to this picturesque retreat by the curative properties of the hot water issuing from the springs and the canyon near by on the west; and also by the abundance of game on all sides, which afforded them food. Here they lived in ease and contentment, in the midst of the inspiring mountains surrounding them, and imagined they saw the Great Spirit in the clouds, and heard him in the wind and thunder.</p>
<p>It happened then, as it has happened since even among civilized communities, that two of these braves fell in love with and sought the hand of a dusky maiden, Maria, daughter of the chief, Gabriel, and so earnestly did they press their devotions that Gabriel was obliged to take these wooings in hand himself, and ordered them settled at once according to the ancient custom of his tribe, the ordeal of mortal combat with bows and arrows, the conqueror to be entitled to his dearly purchased bride. This chieftain fixed the day, summoned all his tribe to attend and see fair play. The solemn day arrived; 40 paces were stepped off by him, the antagonists, Santos and Angelo, were ordered to face one another, the bows were carefully examined and found in excellent condition, the arrows being provided with the hardest and sharpest arrowheads of flint rock that could be found in the mountains; and when all was in readiness, Chief Gabriel having his daughter by his side, gave the command to fire, and the duel was on, but did not last long. But few arrows left their quiver when a well directed arrow from the bow of Angelo pierced the heart of Santos who fell to the ground exclaiming &quot;Maria is yours.&quot; Angelo approached his victim, pulled the bleeding arrow from his dying rival, placed it in his bow and with all his strength, and in the moment of his triumph shot this arrow with its bleeding arrowhead away up on the mountain side where it was imbedded in the earth, and gradually began to grow and finally attained its present size, the noted land mark of the San Bernardino valley, the Arrowhead, that mysterious configuration that attracts the attention and excites the wonder of the thousands who live in and pass through the lovliest valley in all California.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that Chief Gabriel ordered a great feast, and called his tribe together and midst dancing and rejoicing, gave to Angelo his daughter Maria in marriage. The bride and groom lived a long and happy life, whose descendants still live at San Manuel, on the mountain side north of the Southern California State hospital, who treasure this romantic legend and confided it to their old time friend, John Brown Jr., of this city.</p>
<p>As this is the last meeting before Christmas, and in accordance with the Pioneer custom, on motion of Past President Sheldon Stoddard, seconded by Past Presidents Roberds and Thomas, a Merry, Merry Christmas and a Happy, Happy, Happy New Year greeting is extended to all the members of this Pioneer society, to the aged, to the feeble, to the sick, and to all mankind, with the spirit of that sublime and divine message of our Savior, “Peace on Earth; Good Will to Man.”</p>

<p>Sister Jane Smithson referred to her attendance at the Christian church Lincoln day exercises, where she heard his immortal character extolled, and children advised to follow in his footsteps: that girls and boys should go home from school and assist mother and father in home duties and not neglect home by wasting their energies so much in fierce athletic contests that disabled them so they became unfit for both home and school duties.

While crossing the plains his little child, Elnora Hancock, being very ill and all thought she would have to he left on the desert with a little mound over her, and as there was no lumber of material out of which to construct a baby coffin, the father thought he would have to bury his little daughter in this fiddle box, but kind providence decreed otherwise, the little daughter recovered and now is Sister Elnora Hancock Miller, wife of President Miller, and today received that fiddle box from her father, which she will treasure and hand down to her children.</p>

<p>Brother Brown left the following letter explaining his absence: San Bernardino, Calif., February 28, 1914.</p>
<p>To the President, Officers and Members of the Pioneer Society: Please excuse me today for absence, as I am away from your city.

President George Miller, presiding, called Mother Suttenfield and Brothers Tittle and Goodlett as supporters, and expressed thanks to Sister Alexander and Miss June Thompson for beautiful poppies and roses adorning his table, and congratulations to all present on so typical a California day, when all nature seemed filled with gladness.</p>

<p>“John Gammel Worthington was born at Belvine, Ia., November 30, 1847, crossed the plains with his parents in 1853, died in San Bernardino March 1, 1914, leaving his widow, Mrs. Miranda Blackburn Worthington, a sister Mrs. W. S. Tittle of San Bernardino, Mrs. J. C. Waker of Spokane, Wash., and a brother George Worthington of San Bernardino. He was the youngest of 10 children.”</p>
<p>On motion of Bro. R. Y. Roberds, seconded by Sister Miller, the sympathy of the society was extended to the surviving widow and bereaved relatives.</p>
<p>President Miller being called away on important business, requested Brother Roberds to preside during the remainder of the meeting, whose face looked familiar in this position to the older members of the society, who felt like blessing their heavenly Father for keeping and preserving this worthy brother and his beloved wife so long to be cheered by their inspiring presence.</p>
<p>The application or Foster S. Jones for membership was read, and being approved by Brothers Cox, Aldridge and Thomas investigating committee, the candidate was elected an honorary member and eloquently acknowledged the honor conferred on him and paid a becoming tribute to glorious California and the heroic Pioneers.</p>
<p>Sister Miller exhibited a postal card received by Brother Miller from his old friend, Taney Woodward, showing a hunter fleeing from a wounded grizzly bear, which provoked much merriment.</p>
<p>Some early reminiscences were recalled of the late John Holliday, who died the past week at Los Angeles at the advanced age of 93 years, as contained in a clipping presented by Sister Boren. After Sisters Smithson and Yager and Brothers Aldridge, Roberds and Thomas had reviewed the past of 60 years ago, the opinion arrived at was that this John Holliday was not the San Bernardino John Holliday of pioneer days.</p>
<p><strong>Old Trees</strong> - The old pioneer trees still living came up for review by the Pioneers. The two olive trees west of Mr. Haskell's residence on Eighth street, the locust trees in front of Mrs. McKinney's residence on Fifth street, the old pepper tree in front of the Fourth street school were mentioned and the matter will be further considered.</p>
<p>Clippings by Sisters Alexander and Miller were read and enjoyed.</p>
<p>Brother Robert Poppett related his first acquaintance with Uncle Jim Waters in the Santa Clara valley in a wind storm, now 60 years ago [1854 !]</p>
<p><strong>Golden Poppy Club</strong> - Little Miss June Thompson granddaughter of Sister Waters on behalf of the Golden Poppy club, presented the society with a most lovely bouquet of poppies gathered by all the members of such club, and presented by them to the California Pioneers, which sweet token was responded to most felicitously by Sisters Smithson and Alexander and Brothers Thomas, Bledsoe, Tibbert and others. The fact was referred to that Miss Barbara Bledsoe is president of this club and touched the heart of her grandfather, Past President Robert E. Bledsoe. Sister Waters appreciated the participation of her granddaughter, Miss June Thompson in this tribute to the Pioneers, also Mother Crandall that her two grandchildren, Nathan and Lowell Wilson, had contributed their share with the other members. The Golden Poppy club has thus made itself very popular with the Pioneers, and received the blessings of the grandmothers and grandfathers present.</p>
<p>Sympathy was extended to sister jane Smithson in the loss of her home by fire during the week.</p>
<p>A quilting party will be held on Monday afternoon next in the log cabin to replenish necessary bedding.</p>
<p>Mother Luning was in attendance in her wheel chair to receive the benefit derived from communion with her old friends, who gave her an ovation.</p>
<p>President Roberds expressed for the Pioneers admiration for the noble and inspiring sentiments uttered by Brother Tibbett of Riverside, which he referred to the supreme Pioneer, in whose keeping we all live and to the supreme log cabin, where we should all strive to go,</p>

<p>“Want It Named the Pioneer Cemetery, Suggestion First Made by ‘The Sun’ Adopted by the Pioneers,” –</p>
<p>Our good Mother Crandall made a complete change in the seating of the officers and members in the Log Cabin, the officers were placed in the east end of the west room, facing west, while the members and guests faced the east, a convenient arrangement appreciated by all, who expressed thanks and appreciation to this faithful mother.</p>
<p>Past President George Miller presided, calling Sister Belle Robbins Canterberry and Brother Thomas Lackey as supporters and expressed thanks to Mothers Hamilton, Webster, and Evans for flowers.</p>
<p>Mother Holmes met with a serious accident, by falling down her front steps when proceeding to sprinkle her flower lawn, but expects to be up and around again soon. Sinter Lettie Woodward Klein, convalescing nicely; Mother Roberds, improving slowly; the same with Mother Cleghorn; Mother Suttengeld, able to get about the house; Sisters Jane Hunter hopes to spend the Fourth with relatives in San Bernardino; Brother Justus Morse, holding his own; Sister Hansen, quite ill.</p>
<p>Sister Hagan end Brothers Poppett and Lackey appointed a special committee to visit and report on the sick.</p>
<p>W. N. Crandall was admitted a member. He is the son of L. D. and Mary A. Crandall. A hearty pioneer welcome was extended him, which he feelingly and modestly manifested in few well chosen words.</p>
<p>Such faithful members will keep the Pioneer society going , after the present venerable pioneers will not be able to attend when most of them will have passed on to their heavenly home.</p>
<p>Our popular Native Son, John Andreson, Jr., intended to be present and connect himself with the old time friends of his adventurous and highly respected father, John Andreson, who greatly enjoyed the meetings of the Pioneer society.</p>
<p>A proposed amendment to the constitution, aimed by Sheldon Stoddard, Sydney P. Waite and John Brown, Jr., was read, bringing the date to May 10, 1863, when active members can join the society. It was discussed and laid over for one week for final action.</p>
<p>The name brothers introduced the following resolution, which after discussion was, on motion of Sister Harriet Mayfield, seconded by Mother Crandall, unanimously adopted:</p>
<p> “Resolved, by the San Bernardino Society of California Pioneers, that the name of the old city cemetery be changed to Pioneer cemetery, and we recommend our Honorable Mayor, George H. Wixom, and honorable common council to instruct their city attorney to prepare and submit the proper resolution to carry out this resolution.&quot;</p>
<p>Sisters Belle Bobbins Canterberry, Anna Pierce and Devening entertained the meeting with pleasing remarks and expressed appreciation of the kindness and attention shown them. Sister Devening has Just returned from the San Francisco International exposition and wished all the pioneers could attend that gigantic, spectacular, highly instructive and wonderfully beautiful exhibition of the genius of man.</p>
<p>Mr. Kruger was introduced to the society by Brother Lackey, who delivered one of the most eloquent addresses the pioneers have had the pleasure of listening to for many years. He was a pioneer of Illinois, came to California in the early days, but returned to Iowa. His father's uncle was &quot;Ohm Paul' or Paul Kruger.</p>
<p>As the Bummer vacation in nigh, the society decided to have an all day basket picnic at Urbila Springs next Saturday, to which all the pioneers and the children and friends are cordially Invited to participate with well filled baskets of good cheer. Sisters Hagan and Godfrey and Brother Poppett were appointed a committee to arrange for the coffee, sugar and cream.</p>

<p>The pioneers, with their children, grand-children and great grand-children,native sons and daughters, and many friends, enjoyed an all day basket picnic at Urbita Springs, that popular resort of the Southern California Citrus Belt, yesterday, and received many courtesies from Mr. Somer, superintendent of the springs.</p>
<p>By 11 o'clock the pioneer mothers were on hand with well-filled baskets of substantials and delicacies, that by noon were tastefully arranged along the long line of tables in the shade of the lofty willows, and enjoyed by the cheerful throngs.</p>
<p>At 2 o'clock the benches were squared around, and when all were seated, Sister Harriet Mayfield was called to preside, and Sisters McElvaine and Rathbun acted as supporters.</p>
<p>Mothers Roberds, Holmes, Suttenfield and Cleghorn were reported improving. Sister Jane E. Hunter, of Los Angeles, has regained her health so that she hopes to be able to attend the next meeting. Brother John Hansen is quite feeble; so is Pioneer Hack Hurley.</p>
<p>Brother W. S. Tittle was glad to be present, to enjoy the greetings of his old friends, although his hearing has left him and his eyesight Is growing dim, yet he is brave and reconciled to the inevitable changes that must come with advancing years. He has already celebrated his fifty-eighth wedding anniversary, and his forty-six years' residence in San Bernardino, and is now living a quiet and retired life with his faithful wife, and is thankful that his blessings are so favorable as they are. Hearty applause and greetings were extended to him and to his dear wife, who are so well Known and admired for their sterling character.</p>
<p>Sister Knapp sends her best wishes from Seely Flat, where she is a guest of Sister Louisa Waters, and takes pleasure in exhibiting her silver tea pot and silver coffee pot, presented to her by the Pioneers in appreciation of the pine logs furnished by her and her late husband, Brother William Knapp, to the Pioneers for the purpose of building the log cabin.</p>
<p>Sisters Hagan, Godfrey and Brother Robert Poppett reported the picnic arrangements, which were so satisfactory that a vote of thanks was extended to them, and to Brother J. N. Corbett. for taking special charge of the coffee. Mr. Caldwell was also tendered a vote of thanks for a bucketful of luscious strawberry peaches and Chickasaw plums.</p>
<p><strong>Early Picnic Days</strong>. Early picnic days in San Bernardino were adverted to by Sisters Crandall, Alexander, McElvaine, Rathbun, Simpson, Harrison, Godfrey, Hagan, Swarthout, Woodward, Gardner, Downey, Benson, Heath and Bennett, and Brothers McFarlane, Shaw, Corbett and Cox.</p>
<p>This discussion branched off as to how many present drove oxen across the plains, and walked most of the way, and had to travel in bare feet. Several present had this trying experience in crossing the deserts, plains and mountains to California, some as early as 1846. Sisters Hadden and Devening gave interesting reports of their visits to the San Francisco international exposition. Mrs. Krouse, of New York, has become an enthusiastic booster for San Bernardino climate and the grand and picturesque surroundings. She is enjoying a delightful visit with her friend, Sister Gardner, on Ninth street.</p>
<p>As the next meeting falls on July 3, the Pioneers decided to celebrate the day at the log cabin with a basket picnic, to begin at 10 a. m., and Sister Downey was elected as chairman of the committee of arrangements for such patriotic occasion, with power to select her own assistants.</p>
<p>On motion of Sister Crandall the thanks of the Pioneer society are hereby extended to Mr. Somers, superintendent in charge of Urbita Springs, for many courtesies shown by him to the Pioneers, including Merry-go-round, Roller Coaster, Scenic Railroad, Boating and Bathing privileges accorded these venerable mothers and fathers who deeply appreciate these manifestations of regard, and who will remember that native son of- San Bernardino, the worthy president of the Pacific Electric system of California, Mr. Paul Shoup, who will never forget, with his many assistants, the active part taken by the people of San Bernardino in general and the Pioneers in particular, in driving the last spike that united the Pacific Electric road between San Bernardino and Los Angeles.</p>

<p>“Pioneers,” – Disinterested visitors at the log cabin in Pioneer park were signally favored yesterday in being able to participate in a gathering that in all probability will never be duplicated in this city. It was the ninety-fourth birthday of Uncle Joseph Hancock, and his family connections came to do him honor.</p>
<p>Chief among these was Aunt Nancy Daley, widow of the late Edward Daley, and daughter of the late Captain Hunt, and the mother of some of the most prominent residents of this valley.</p>
<p>Sister Daley presented a motion of honor and respect for the guest of the day, and stated that she had known him for 82 years [1834] , ever since he came to her father's house when she was 7 years old, one evening, shouting, &quot;Wolf!&quot; &quot;Wolf!&quot; &quot;Come out with your gun and shoot the wolf!&quot; She said that in all the 82 years of acquaintanceship and friendship she had known Uncle Joseph as the soul of honor.</p>
<p>The meeting was called to order by President Boren at 2 o'clock. Sister Crouse at the piano and Brother Morse with the violin accompanied the opening ode, which was sung with fervor, all present participating. An invocation was offered by Chaplain Shaw. Uncle Joseph Hancock and Aunt Nancy Daley were the right and left hand supporters. The president thanked all those who had decorated the tables with beautiful flowers Sisters Alexander, Harrison, Nora Miller, J. O. Lamb, Girard, Case, Hamilton and Crouse. There were roses, baby roses and roses grown up, and of many varieties, sweet William, carnations, geraniums, hollyhocks, Shasta daisies and greenery.</p>
<p>Reports from the sick showed all under the weather greatly improved. Sister Jane Smithson reported for the committee on May day, a glorious celebration, and a signal success. The queen of May, Sister Harrison, the bishop, Brother Robert Poppett, and many others made very pleasant remarks. The treasurer, Sister Alexander, reported all bills paid and a handsome balance in the treasury. Russell Collins, a poly high student, reported for about 50 other young people of the city, that grandchildren of pioneers had organized a society called &quot;The Young Pioneer Club,&quot; to operate under the rules and regulations of the Pioneer society, with the main object of furnishing additions to the program of the Saturday afternoon Pioneer meetings. By vote, presented by Father Hancock and seconded by Mother Daley, the young people were heartily thanked for their kind plans for the society.</p>
<p>Under &quot;good of the order,&quot; the president called on Secretary John Brown, Jr., to engineer the program of the day. The following relatives of Uncle Joseph Hancock were present and took part:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sister Nora Miller, a daughter,</p></li>
<li><p>Sister Jerusha Tyler, a daughter,</p></li>
<li><p>Sister Molly Tyler Bright, a granddaughter, and her mother.</p></li>
<li><p>Sister J. S. Bright;</p></li>
<li><p>our Sister J O. Lamb, a granddaughter.</p></li>
<li><p>Master James Lamb,</p></li>
<li><p>Miss Myrtle Lamb, and</p></li>
<li><p>Master Charles Bright, great great grandchildren.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It was reported that Miss Lois Erma Bausch, 2 days old, was great great grand daughter of Uncle Joseph Hancock, and that the little miss had four happy grandmothers and four proud grandfathers. In this connection, Sister Kirkpatrick rose to say that she was the great grandmother of a boy who has seven grandmothers and two grandfathers. Other great, great grandmothers, grandfathers and grandmothers would have reported, but time was limited.</p>
<p>At this point the master of ceremonies spoke of Uncle Joseph Hancock, stating that his grandfather was Henry Hancock, who was a soldier of the revolutionary war, and a brother of John Hancock, chairman of the declaration of Independence committee, and one of the signers of that famous document. John Hancock was a shoemaker, and his hammer is now in the possession of the Pioneer society, among its treasures. Sister Nora Miller then stated that she would like to honor her mother's memory. Her name was Nancy A. Hancock and she then unrolled a package in which was carefully preserved a pair of &quot;cards&quot; her mother had used, and proceeded to &quot;card&quot; some cotton, first making a &quot;bat&quot; to be used as stuffing for a quilt, and then a &quot;roll&quot; to be spun into thread, all of which was of exceeding interest to the entire company. The guest of honor made a few remarks, expressing his delight at being present and stating that his present occupation was the very pleasant one of driving about the valley with his own horse and rig, calling on old acquaintances, and enjoying the outdoors. He stated that he had seen seven generations of his own blood relatives, having called on the latest baby, and having seen his honored grandfather.</p>
<p>Fitting resolutions were heartily passed extending to Father Hancock and also to Mother Daley the love and respect of the society, and congratulating them on their remarkable preservation. Sister Hadden and Jane Smithson, and Brother Poppett, and many others spoke to these resolutions.</p>
<p>At this point. Sister Hadden was asked to take up the duties of master of ceremonies. Two magnificent candle crowned birthday cakes were brought in, one made-by Mrs. Charles Tyler and the other by Mrs. Molly Tyler Bright. Also three, other toothsome cakes, made by Mrs. Nora Miller and Mrs. J. O. Lamb. Also, a mug to be a token of love from the whole society, and a jar of marmalade from the Orange show by-product department. The candles were lighted by the relatives of Father Hancock, he and Aunt Nancy Daley lighting a few, Mrs. Bright sang &quot;California&quot; and &quot;My Dear Little Irish Rose,&quot; with her usual gracious and pleasing manner. Mrs. R. F. Garner then presented a large dish of delicious sweets and made most fitting remarks on her pressure at being present.</p>
<p>The formal part was here quietly shaded into informalities, while Sister Clara Case and Brother Morse furnished appropriate music for the usual &quot;light fantastic&quot; and the partaking of refreshments.</p>

<p>“Pioneers,” - Standing room was at a premium today as so many of the member were present. Also there were quite a large number of visitors who passed a very pleasant afternoon. The flower attracted the attention of all, especially the poppies which were created by Sister Crouse and which everyone believed were early poppies gathered from some secluded vale. There were pansies, violets, ialla lilies and nasturtiums as well as white sage, smilax and other greenery. Sisters Wilfong, Annie Alexander, Mary Crandall, George Miller and Crouse were complimented by the president for the wonderful array of beautiful flowers.</p>
<p>President Boren chose Brother and Sister Wilfong for his supporters saying that he did not like to separate a man from his wife. Prof. J. Morse and Nathan Wilson entertained for some time prior to the opening with several favorite pioneer pieces. Sister Case took the piano and with Brother Morse accompanied the opening and closing odes. All the officer responded to the roll call with the exception of our good brother, John Brown, Jr., who is with his daughter, Mrs. Wiggett in Alamegordo, New Mexico.</p>
<p>Quite a large number were reported as being on the sick list. Sister Swarthout is just about the same. Sister French's boy is much better which all were glad to hear. Brother Downey is still at the hospital and would like very much to have the pioneers visit him. Brother Alfred Frintz one of the very oldest of the members is in a critical condition. Brother S. P. Waite and Sister Waite are both unable to leave the house. Sister Atwood is much better.

Brother Dodson continues in his usual condition being confined to his home. Brother F. L. Talmadge it was pleasing to learn, is able to sit up. Sister Nickerson is gradually improving.</p>
<p>The sympathy of the pioneers was extended to the secretary, Brother John Brown, Jr., his daughter and family on the loss by death of Charles J. Wiggett in Alamogordo recently. This is a real loss and is felt by the pioneers as well as the family on account of the very active Interest Brother Brown takes in the society of pioneers.</p>
<p>A very well known pioneer In the person of Etta V. Kleinhaus who met with an auto accident resulting in her death and the narrow escape of her husband will be missed from among her friends. The sympathy of the society was voted to those who were so suddenly deprived of their loved one.</p>
<p>From Decoto, California comes the report of the death of Mrs. Rebecca Perrish Dunlap who up to a few years ago was so well known in this city and who has not been forgotten by her pioneer friends. Again the sympathy for the bereaved relatives was extended.</p>
<p>Thursday the 22nd is the day designated as pioneer day of the Orange show and all the pioneers will be admitted all day provided they wear their badges. A number are planning to meet at the tent at 10 o'clock a.m. and go through together.</p>
<p>The marmalade committee is making splendid progress and Sister Smithson and other members are receiving a great deal of praise. Every one will be represented, even the sick members will have their name on the jelly glasses. Sister Jane Hunter has sent two dozen and these are to be used in case there are not enough. Sister Hunter expects to attend the orange show.</p>
<p>A committee consisting of George Miller, Charles Mecham and Silas Cox was appointed to act in conjunction with the president and secretary to investigate the matter of qualifications for membership and If necessary submit an amendment to the constitution.</p>
<p>A communication from Brother and Sister Tittle who are now at Needles was read with much interest.</p>

<p>“Pioneers,” – A beautiful California day brought the members out to the meeting on Saturday in large numbers filling the cabin. President Boren presided having for his supporters Sister McElvaine and Brother Fessenden. Sister Annie Alexander brought the beautiful pansies that were seen on the president's table with violets and poppies. The roll call showed that Sister Mary Crandall was absent as she was in Los Angeles This was made the more noticeable as a pioneer meeting does not seem complete without Sister Crandall.</p>
<p>Brother Robert Poppett was reported improving after undergoing an operation. Word came from Needles that Brother Tittle fell from his son's auto and sustained quite severe injuries; however, Brother Tittle sent his greetings to the pioneers. All were glad to hear from Brother Alfred Printz as he is now able to be around the house again. Sister Hadden was reported quite ill.</p>
<p>Brother Talmadge at Victorville is continuing about the same. Sister Aldridge also is resting quite well. Brother George Pierce is still confined to the house. Brother and Sister Kinderman are both able to be out and enjoy the beautiful weather that we are now having.</p>
<p>A number of Pioneers spoke of knowing Brother and Sister Porter in the early days and while they were neither members of the society a vote of sympathy and condolence was taken for the sorrowing relatives and friends. William R. Porter's death followed that of Mrs. Porter within a week.</p>
<p>Brother McFarlane reported that May 10, 1869, was the date of driving of the golden spike and all pioneers coming here previous to this date should be considered eligible to join the society.</p>
<p>It was voted that all the marmalade that was left should be donated to the county hospital and Brother George Miller volunteered to deliver it. The committee was discharged with the thanks of the society.</p>
<p>Sister Miller started a discussion on how to grow onions which proved quite interesting.</p>
<p>Brother Jonathan Tibbetts spoke of meeting Sister Jane Hunter in Los Angeles recently, also ex-Sheriff Burns of Los Angeles county, who crossed the plains with his father. Brother Tibbetts stands for perpetuating the pioneer spirit and told several interesting pioneer stories.</p>
<p>Brother George Miller held the meeting for half an hour telling of a trip he took during his boyhood days. He had for companions Paul Van Curen, a man by the name of Landers, and William Rhodes. They were always guarding against Indians and over in Death Valley district while following the wagon, ox, and horse tracks of the unfortunate settlers who went there and perished they came upon three Indians. All around there were pieces of iron off the wagons which had been burned by the Indians. Soon about 35 more came to rescue their friends, but as they had no guns there was no trouble. Taking one as a guide, they went to the further end of the valley where, although no vegetation was visible, they found a water hole in the ridges also a large number of Piutes who it seems were hunting ducks. Brother Miller described their manner of cooking and eating. They seemed to subsist on tullies, ducks, and lizards. A gambling game was in progress and one prosperous buck lost all the clothes he possessed. The object of the trip was to find the money that was buried by the settlers before they tiled and a very rich mine that was reported to be in that territory. Neither was found and the party soon returned to San Bernardino.</p>
<p>Sister Crouse called attention to the fact that today was St. Patrick’s day and that St. Patrick was a pioneer in his country.</p>
<p>Lawrence B. Gannon of Chicago was a very interested visitor.</p>
<p>Sister Case and Brother Morse entertained with music after the closing of the meeting.</p>

<p><strong>3 Apr 1917</strong> – SBS 9 – RapPIONEER</p>
<p>“Pioneers,” – Spring weather Saturday filled the log cabin and with the songs of birds filled the air outside and floating in the open door the pioneers enjoyed the afternoon as much as though they were in some mountain meadow. President Wilford A. Boren called the meeting to order with A. P. Kuffell and Sister Mary Clews as his supporters. Sisters Wiltfong, George Miller, and Annie Alexander furnished some very beautiful flowers. Roses, pansies, lilacs of several varieties, bachelor buttons, and poppies formed bouquets on the president's table and filled the air with their perfume. Our young brother Nathan Wilson presided at the piano, and with Prof. J. Morse, the veteran violinist, and &quot;Uncle Billy&quot; Stephen, the celebrated pioneer, with his concertina, furnished the pioneer music for the occasion.</p>
<p>The regular form was used in opening. Sister Mary Crandall was missed in the roll call as was Brother John Brown, Jr., who has returned to San Bernardino, but was not able to attend this afternoon. Many expected to see our secretary, having heard of his return.</p>
<p>Sister Mary Crandall was reported as being in poor health which was the cause of her absence. Sister Fannie Crouse was not reported last week. She is much improved and sent her best wishes. Willard Souther is confined to his bed. Brother and Sister George Miller visited Brother Frank Talmadge at Victorville during the week and found Brother Talmadge improving. Brother Robert Poppett is getting along very nicely, all were glad to hear. Brother Kinderman had a very bad night Friday night and was not able to be out to the meeting today. President Wilford A.

Brother Alfred Printz is doing fine and hopes to be out to the meetings again.</p>

The ever-ready sympathy of the pioneers for one of their number was voted to the Kinderman family in the loss of the daughter and sister, Mrs. Lyda Robbs. Also, sympathy was extended to the Lyman family in their bereavement. Mrs. Rhoda Lyman having passed away at Salt Lake City.</p>
<p>A new member was voted upon and elected to membership in the society in the person of Mabel Clair Webster Harris. She is the, daughter of Joseph and Mary Webster, pioneers who came here in the fifties.</p>
<p>The committee on the monument who were appointed to meet with the Native Sons in Cajon Pass in regard to the making of the monument more prominent, reported that they had decided with the Native Sons' committee that the best way was to place merely a marker by the highway and erect a worthy monument to the early pioneers in the Pioneer Park of this city. The committee was discharged and a new committee was appointed to act for three years or until the monument is erected. Silas Cox, Sheldon Stoddard, Harriette Mayfield, Mary Crandall, and Sydney P. Waite compose the new committee, all of whom crossed the plains with ox teams.</p>
<p>Two poems from the hand of C. L. Thomas were read. One was &quot;Crisis' and the other &quot;George Washington,&quot; both patriotic.</p>
<p>A clipping telling of the noble work Arrowhead parlor of Native Sons has undertaken in erecting a monument in Pioneer park to the memory of the early settlers was read by Silas Cox.</p>

<p>Brother Jonathan Tibbetts was presented with an ox shoe by George Miller, one which was found on the Miller ranch in Highland.</p>
<p>Brother John Brown Jr., the pioneer secretary, sent his regards to the meeting and will no doubt be present next week.</p>
<p>“Uncle Billy” Stephen came down from his mountain retreat to say “hello” to John Brown and also took in the meeting this afternoon. He told of the snow in the mountains this year which has beaten the record of “Uncle Billy’s” 26 years’ experience, and carried his hearers back to the pioneer days by rendering “The Days of Old, the Days of Gold, the Days of ’49.” “Uncle Billy” had his concertina along and used it to good advantage.</p>
<p>All joined in singing the closing ode and were dismissed with the benediction by Rev. George h. Wixom.</p>
<p>The visitors were: Mrs. Kate McGraw, Flora McElhaney, Mrs. F. C. Hagan, Mrs. S. M. Webster, and Mrs. E. H. Kingbury of Edgeron, Minnesota.</p>

<p>President Boren, chairman on the committee for revising the constitution, reported that action was taken by the society on July 10, 1915, fixing May 10, 1869, as the date fixed for the election of active members of the society, the constitution of the society being thus amended on suggestion of Past President Uncle Sheldon Stoddard, Sydney P. Waite and Secretary Brown, three .., and among the oldest members of the society. May 10, 1869, was the day when the last rail was laid and last spike driven on the union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads, at Promentory point, 1,086 miles west of the Missouri river, and 690 miles east of Sacramento, California, as telegraphed by President Leland Stanford to the Associated Press east and west on that day.</p>
<p>By adopting the amendment fixing this date the pioneers decided that those who came by rail, thus avoiding the trials and dangers of crossing the plains with oxen, mules or horses, were not eligible as active members, but could be elected as honorary members, as provided in the constitution. The committee was discharged.</p>
<p>Secretary Brown, chairman, reported favorable progress for the May day committee that Superintendent Henry Froud would welcome the pioneer and all their friends, including the members of the Native Daughters and Native Sons; W.

<p><strong>Sixty-fourth Anniversary of County</strong>. The pioneers well remember April 26, 1853, for on that day the legislature of California passed the act creating the county of San Bernardino from the eastern portion of Los Angeles county. By that act section five, Colonel Isaac Williams, David Seely, John Brown, and H. G. Sherwood were appointed and constituted a board of commissioners to designate the election precincts in the new county of San Bernardino; for the election of the officers at the first election; to appoint the inspectors of election; to receive the returns of election and to issue certificates of election.</p>
<p>In accordance with such act, an election was held in January 1854, and certificates of election were issued by this board to D. M. Thomas, county judge; Robert Ciift, sheriff; R. R. Hopkins, county clerk; V. J. Herring, county assessor; William Stout, district attorney; H. G. Sherwood, surveyor, Andrew Lytle and John Brown, justices of the peace. Captain Jefferson Hunt, already a representative from Los Angeles county, was elected representative of the new county of San Bernardino. April 26, 1853 - April 26, 1917, 64 years. All hall to the grand old county of San Bernardino; anJ to those brave and In tiepld pioneers who started things for us 64 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Happy Surprise</strong> – Miss Avis Holcomb, granddaughter of our beloved &quot;Bill Holcomb,&quot; daughter of our highly esteemed Native Son, Frank Holcomb, surprised the pioneers by appearing with her school of fairies of spring, and delighted and inspired the venerable members with the loveliest songs of spring. Most hearty vote of thanks given. President Boren and Brother George Miller decorated Miss Holcomb with a small silk, flag, and she returned the compliment by placing a badge, Old Glory, on President Boren.</p>
<p>Uncle Joseph Hancock stood, resting on his crutches and moved that the American flag continue to wave over the log cabin, and over the land of the free, and the home of the brave. Uncle Joe is a relative of the immortal John Hancock, and so, although 90 years of age, is filled with the spirit of 1776.</p>
<p>Miss Holcomb was then conducted with her beautiful fairies of spring to Mrs. Bradley' where they enjoyed the hospitality and generosity of the pioneers.</p>

<p>“Several Very Aged Pioneers Attend Meeting of Argonauts,” –</p>
<p>&quot;Your Flag and my Flag and how it flies today,</p>
<p>In your land and my land and half a world away;</p>
<p>Rose-red and blood-red Its stripes forever gleam;</p>
<p>Snow-white and soul-white, the good forefather's dream;</p>
<p>Sky-blue and true-blue, and set with stars aright;</p>
<p>The gloried guerdon of the day, the shelter of the night.&quot;</p>
<p>Although there was not as large a number in attendance today as last week, yet there were so many last Saturday that the cabin was crowded and today's attendance naturally seemed small.</p>
<p>President Wilford A. Boren called the meeting to order in the usual manner at the regular hour. Two of our pioneer members, who have been on the sick list have regained their health and were with us today. Both of these are over 90 years of age and were appointed by the president as supporters, Brother William S. Tittle and Brother Alfred Printz, two pioneers who for 90 years and more have led vigorous lives. Brother George I. Burton, who Is past his ninetieth birthday, was also present. The flower committee received the thanks of the president for the display of roses, poppies, pansies and greenery that always adds to the occasion. Sisters Mary Crandall, Mahala Wiltfong, Ellen Smith, Fannie Crouse, Annie Alexander and Jane Evans are very faithful on the decorating committee.</p>
<p>Prof. J. Morse and Brother Nathan Wilson played several selections of pioneer music that gave color to the meeting that followed. This music is all that Is needed to make the gatherings intensely interesting.</p>
<p>Sister Sarah Yager has returned to her San Bernardino home and being unable to attend today sent her greetings to her old friends. The following sick members, all were glad to hear, were on the mend: Sister Harriet Roberds. Sister Mary Webster, Sister Stephens, Sister Jane Smithson, and Brother Robert Poppett, Brother John Hudson, who is a shut-in, would appreciate a call from some of the pioneers, as would Sister Stephens.</p>
<p><strong>Votes of Sympathy</strong>. Sisters Harrison and Reetta V. Hadden and Brothers Alfred Printz and William S. Tittle were present today for the first time this year. Theirs has been the misfortune of being sick – a very sad misfortune sometimes.</p>
<p>The society remembered the pioneer relatives and friends so recently bereft with a vote of sympathy and condolence.</p>
<p>Charles Garner, I. H. Curtis and June Holmes, the great-granddaughter of Mother Holmes, are those whose faces and presence we miss from our midst.</p>
<p>Two applications for membership were received, and being qualified were unanimously elected. Legare Allen, who came to San Francisco in 1875 by way of the Isthmus of Panama, from Kalamazoo, Michigan, and Emma M. Allen, his wife, are the new members.</p>
<p>Mrs. Martha L. Kiplinger, manager of the Opera House, sent the following letter in response to the vote from the Pioneers, in which they extended thanks for the courtesy of seeing the picture, &quot;The Argonauts of California:</p>
<p>&quot;May 18, 1917.</p>
<p>Mr. John Brown, Jr., Secretary Pioneer Society of San Bernardino.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Brown,</p>
<p>I want to thank you for the fine letter you wrote in THE SUN today. I appreciate particularly that which you said about my father. I was very glad Indeed that the pioneers could see &quot;The Argonauts&quot;, as my guests, and sorry that more could not come. With my respects to the society, I am,</p>
<p>Sincerely yours, M. L. KIPLINGER”</p>
<p>A number of pioneers availed themselves of the privilege of seeing &quot;The Argonauts.&quot; This picture brought back the early life and all its rough side with a rush, and many could not but express their thoughts and exclaim, &quot;I have done that same thing myself.&quot;</p>

<p>On motion the Pioneers decided to join the G. A. R. and W. R. C. and all patriotic citizens including the children, in commemorating Memorial day in a fitting manner as has been the custom with the Pioneers for many years.</p>

<p>“In my slumber, I had jolted</p>
<p>To the rearmost rim about me,</p>
<p>When the end-gate got unbolted</p>
<p>And the train moved on without me.</p>
<p>How long I lay there in the road</p>
<p>I cannot say, this minute;</p>
<p>But when my mother searched the load</p>
<p>She found I was not In It.</p>
<p>Now memory sees the little scamp</p>
<p>With instinct to follow after.</p>
<p>With joyous welcome into camp,</p>
<p>The tears, the smiles, the laughter.</p>
<p>A story telling of the way George Miller used to drive his auto was very Interesting.</p>

<p>“Pioneers Observe Birthday of President Wilford Boren,” – “Oh the heart that has truly loved never forgets. But as truly love on to the close.”</p>
<p>A rich musical treat awaited all those attending the Pioneer meeting yesterday. It was in honor of President Boren's birthday which occurred last Wednesday and the old melodies and folk songs carried us all back to childhood.</p>

<p>“May Early Day Reminiscences Are Recalled by the Pioneers,” – California weather was at its best yesterday and the little log cabin surrounded by the lawn and hidden among the great pepper trees of the Pioneer park was the Mecca of a large number of the early settlers of the valley. Each one has a life story that runs like a story-book and adventures that have never been chronicled. At the regular weekly meeting these bygone days are lived over again and again each time with renewed interest.</p>
<p>In the absence of the regular president, Brother Boren; Vice President Charles Mecham presided with Brother and Sister Wiltfong, who celebrated their fortieth wedding anniversary last week, as his supporters.</p>
<p>A wealth of roses, marigolds, asters, chrysanthemums, and fragrant lemon verbena seemed to cover the president’s table. They came from the gardens of the pioneers. Sisters Wiltfong, Jane Smithson, Boren, Alexander, and Evans each bringing her favorite flowers and Brother Brown who for years has taken care of an old verbena built in his yard, brought verbena.</p>
<p>Brothers Jasper Wixom, Dodson, and Robert Poppett were reported as being about the same; Sisters Legare Allen and Holcomb improving.</p>
<p>Another relic in the form of a gourd was presented to the society this afternoon by Silas C. Cox. The gourd is in the shape of a baseball bat and a little more than three feet in length. This resemblance brought forth many early baseball experiences. It is inscribed “Grown by S. C. Cox, 1917.”</p>
<p>Sister Woodward read a clipping “Word and Smile” Sister Alexander’s “Story of a Mule” was amusing; and Sister Jane Smithson also read a very choice clipping.</p>
<p>Brother John Brown, Jr., conducted a so-called floral wedding in which the lily was wedded to the jonquil. The ceremony was performed by Jack-in-pulpit assisted by cardinal red and all the other flowers played very prominent parts.</p>
<p>Interesting reminiscences by Silas Cox and Aunt Harriet Mayfield made the time go by only too quickly. Brother Cox told of tying a cannon on a mule's back, and how the mule became frightened when the fuse was lit and breaking away, was running when the cannon went off. This was only one of the many incidents that happened during the early pioneer days. Born in Alabama in 1847, his father, A. J. Cox, took him when only a small boy to Utah and to California in 1850, arriving in San Bernardino in 1852. In 1861 young Cox took the prize for horsemanship in Los Angeles; was married the same year and went to teaming between San Bernardino and Salt Lake, City.</p>
<p>Sister Harriet Mayfield was born In Missouri where her father, Captain Jefferson Hunt, had a large mill, which was sold when the family moved to Illinois to take up farming. This farm in turn was sold when Captain Hunt received orders for the Mormons to assemble at Salt Lake. On the trip the president sent a call for volunteers to fight the Indians and 500 of the party went, Captain Hunt commanding. The trip to Salt Lake and finally to San Bernardino with its many startling adventures in crossing the deep rivers and meeting Indians, with the assistance of Captain Hunt, who met them in Salt Lake, has a touch of human interest coming as it does from those who have actually witnessed these events.</p>
<p>Votes of thanks were given to both Sister Mayfield and Brother Cox for their brief memoirs and to Brother Cox for the gourd. Brother, and Sister John Case sang &quot;Where There Is a Will There Is a Way&quot; and the meeting adjourned to meet again next Saturday.</p>

Later these were taken to the bedsides of the sick members and aided in diverting their thoughts from their pain. Sister Annie Alexander and Miller and Brother Charles Mecham acted on the flower committee.</p>
<p>Sister Hellen Smith was reported as being better and resting easy. Sister Van Doren Aldridge is bedfast and having been away from the meetings for a year, longs to have the pioneers call on her. Sister Emma Morse was present to speak for herself. Brothers Poppett and Wixom are about the same. Our President Boren met with a very serious accident on Friday and has had to undergo an operation at the Ramona hospital.</p>

<p>The congratulations of the society were extended to the young pioneer, Lewis Milton Shaw, and his mother, who were remembered with a bouquet of roses.</p>
<p><strong>Some of Old Songs</strong>. &quot;Uncle Billy&quot; Stephen, who had joined with Brother Caley and Prof. Morse in the opening ode, sang &quot;Days of 49&quot; and &quot;God Bless the Pioneers,&quot; accompanying himself on his concertina.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. H. M. Noyes of New York, Capt. and Mrs. Thomas Wycoff of Michigan, and Mr. Myers of Oklahoma, all spoke of their interest and connections with the pioneers of their respective states.</p>
<p>Sister Woodward reported having received a letter from Brother Tittle.</p>
<p>The pioneer trio gave a short program of instrumental pieces such as delight the hearts of the '49ers.</p>
<p>Brother and Sister Case sang &quot;Mother Machree&quot; and 'Home Again.&quot;</p>

<p>The welcome rain of yesterday did not keep the pioneers at home, but rather increased the number at the meeting and filled up the log cabin.

A committee was appointed to cooperate with the Native Sons in this commendable work. Sisters Hagan, Crandall and Smithson and Secretary Brown will act on the committee.</p>
<p>The following excellent address was delivered by Mrs. Lettie Woodward Keir at the dedication of the pioneer monument in Cajon pass, December 23, 1917, representing the Native Daughters of the Golden West. A copy is being preserved in the pioneer records:</p>
<p><strong>Monument Address</strong>.</p>
<p>Friends, and Dear Pioneers: - It is indeed a blessed privilege to be allowed the honor of accepting, in behalf of the Native Daughters of the Golden West, this gift, a share in this beautiful monument, that stands at the gateway, and marks the path of our beloved parents, into this lovely valley. And though words seem inadequate, I want to express the appreciation of the Native Daughters for this beautiful gift, and also for the many wonderful things that have come to us through your heroic efforts.</p>
<p>Sixty-eight years ago today, the dear souls that had the brains and brawn to leave their homes and journey across almost unknown wilds, with danger linking at every turn, arrived at this spot and, looking, saw that great valley just beyond. Keeping straight ahead, with their covered wagons and a few &quot;gees&quot; and &quot;haws&quot; to trusty oxen, and probably hub deep in mud, but with light hearts, they arrived in San Bernardino, just a few days before Christmas. What a wonderful Christmas it must have been for those men and women. But times have changed indeed. I think you builded better than you knew.</p>
<p>Today we left the city at 9 o'clock, in conveyances propelled by their own motive power, over the same road, but smoothly paved, and arrived here in just 45 minutes. Ask Grandfather Stoddard, or any of the boys, and they will assure you that thy did not make that time in ’49 [1849].</p>
<p>It seems like a dream, does it not. But it must be a very beautiful dream to the men and women who have lived during those interesting years.</p>
<p>A friend of mine said to me, “Letty, all of the old pioneers seem like brothers and sisters.” Well, they are. In spirit they have always lived in one great brotherhood. They lived during the times that tried men’s souls, never thinking of self, but the protection of all. Social rank was cast aside and every man was his brother’s keeper. And they learned, through hard knocks, that wonderful lesson of brotherly love and self-denial. Times of great stress surely make us all of one kin.</p>
<p>Now we are in the midst of this terrible turmoil, for this is indeed the world’s stupendous hour, and I hope that if we, your sons and daughters, are called upon to do seemingly hard tasks, that we may have the courage and will-power of our parents to say, yes, gladly and do it with a smile. If we are called upon to give up this, that or the other thing, that seems so essential to us, let us close our eyes and see, many years ago, the covered wagons crawling across the great expanse of desert and those men and women trudging most of that weary distance and sometimes with no covering for their feet and sometimes with scarcely food enough to keep body and soul together, many of them giving up their lives. Then today picture our boys in uniform, giving their young lives to save our precious freedom and we will not mind giving up anything or everything that the world may enjoy the same great and blessed democracy that has been our heritage.</p>
<p>We, your children, are glad to be able to meet you here today and in the name of the present generation in the name of Liberty to thank you.</p>

<p>Mention was made of the Lincoln day celebration at the poly high auditorium and was regarded by those competent to judge as the most patriotic gathering ever assembled in the San Bernardino, valley. The 150 veterans of the civil war and members of the Woman's Relief corps seated on the platform were an inspiration to the student body from the preparatory and high schools. The program prepared under the direction of President Beeman was of the most patriotic character. The excellent order maintained by the thousand students present during the exercises and lengthy wait at the beginning won the admiration of all observers.</p>

<p>“Died,” – POPPETT - In San Bernardino, California, Wednesday, February 27, 1918. Robert Poppett, age 78 years, native of England. No funeral arrangements have been made. The Mark B. Shaw company is in charge.</p>
<p>SBS 5 –</p>
<p>“Robert Poppett, Prominent as Pioneer, Passes on Last Eve; Enoch Wiltfong, Pioneer, Also,” –</p>
<p>Robert Poppett, after many other remedies have failed, died last night at his home in 1431 D street, closing a life, the incidents of which assembled would read like fiction. He was born at Shropshire, April 28, 1839, one of the early pioneers of the San Bernardino valley when it was in the rough.</p>
<p>He was 78 years of age and a native of England, but came to America when but 10 years of age. With the adventurers of the early fifties, he drifted westward and after a thrilling trip from Utah he settled in this valley in 1854, making it his home since that time.</p>
<p>For the past few years, Mr. Poppett had been in ill health and some time ago underwent an operation in the effort to better his health. He apparently was recovering when he suffered a relapse and his death last night not entirely unexpected, but the cause of sorrow among the hundreds of people who had known him for many years and among the members of a large family.</p>
<p>He made his home at 1431 D street for many years following his retirement from a life of activity and usefulness. Mr. Poppett was a familiar figure among the citizens of the city years ago and of late years was one of the most conspicuous of the Pioneer society members.</p>
<p>He came to San Bernardino in 1854 and like many other of the young men of that period, he became a freight and stage team driver across the desert, making long trips to desert points. He later became a rancher.</p>
<p>In 1863 he married Miss Alice Case of this city and to them were born 12 children, 10 of whom are living at the present. They are John R., G. W., Edward, Huley, Thurman, Morrison, F., Ira and Grover Poppett. Mrs. Irene Hitchcock and Miss Leah Poppett.</p>
<p>A complete biography appears in Ingersoll's history as follows: …</p>

Shaw company, but the exact time has not yet been decided upon, pending the arrive of a relative to this city.</p>
<p>Mr. Poppett had been in poor health for some time. He recently underwent an operation. He came to San Bernardino in 1854 and became a freight and state team driver across the desert, making long trips to desert points. He later became a rancher.</p>
<p>In 1863 he married Miss Alice Case of this city and to them were born twelve children, ten of whom are living at the present. They are John R., G. W., Edward, Huley, Thurman, Morrison, F., Ira and Grover Poppett, Mrs. Irene Hitchcock and Miss Leah Poppett.</p>

<p>“Pioneer Gently Laid to His Last Rest, Final Obsequies are Held for the Late Robert Poppett by the Argonauts,”</p>
<p>The second day of spring turned out to be a perfect day and a very large number of pioneers met at the log cabin at 1:30 o'clock yesterday, owing to the good work of Mothers Crandall and Waters in, notifying the members. There were automobiles enough to accommodate all and conveyed them to the Poppett home at 1431 E street, arriving in time to attend the funeral of our late brother pioneer, Robert Poppett, later following with hundreds of other dear friends to the City cemetery to pay their last respects to one whom they loved, honored and respected. This was made possible by the kindness of the Fraternal Order of Eagles whose members furnished their automobiles to serve the pioneers.</p>
<p>There was a wealth or beautiful flowers which, seemed to cover all traces of sadness as they were arranged around the casket, and in a prominent place, for Brother Poppett thought a great deal of the pioneers, was a pillow marked &quot;Pioneer.&quot; Secy. John Brown, Jr., read the pioneer service at the residence and added much, which only one who knew could add, of the personal touch the intimate acquaintance making a very beautiful service. Rev. Mark B. Shaw read the eulogy for the family. The choir, composed of Mr. and Mrs. F. H. Magoffin, Mrs. J. C. Allison and J. B. Phillips, accompanied by Mrs. Phillips, sang beautifully several appropriate selections, among them, &quot;Shall We Gather at the River?&quot; At the grave Phoenix lodge 178 F. and A. M. took charge and held their regular service, William T. Hamblin, worshipful master, and W. J. Kinley, chaplain, being in charge.

Horace Clark grew up at Independence, which was then a small town on the western frontier and participated in many of the thrilling events of early days, incident to the immense emigration from east and south to the Pacific coast, a large share of which made Independence its place of rendezvous for departure westward. Horace when little more than a youth commenced carrying U. S. mail between Independence and Salt Lake, and in 1853 was with Sheldon Stoddard, John Hunt, Sidney P. Waite and the lamented John Maxfield among the first to carry the mail between Salt Lake and San Bernardino. Later he for years engaged in freighting across the desert, and latterly for about 9 years was an employee of San Bernardino city and in charge of the city park and pavillion.

He determined to come on to California in 1854, this being the result of his travels as a freighter, for he had made the trip across by way of the Mormon trail, and for 10 years after his arrival in San Bernardino or until the construction of the Pacific railroads, he drove his heavy mule teams back and forth between San Bernardino and Salt Lake. After that became unecessary he freighted here in Southern California and between here and Arizona, and then when teaming no longer offered inducements, his love for animals was such that he could not get entirely away from them, and he devoted himself to blacksmithing until perhaps 220 years ago when he retired from active work.
