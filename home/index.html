<h1 id="a-wandering-saint-finds-home">A Wandering Saint Finds Home</h1>
<p>In 1848, when established political order in Europe was under threat, the LDS church leaders increased their focus upon the <a href="/places/britain/british-mission/index.html">British Mission</a>. Membership ranks swelled. Seeing a growth opportunity for the newly created Mormon headquarters in Utah, British Mission president Orson Pratt called all Saints to gather to the Salt Lake Valley. In the next two years, 4,229 Mormons left Liverpool for Zion. My 2<sup>nd</sup> great grandfather <a href="/poppett-gallery/robert-albert-poppett/profile/index.html">Robert Poppett</a> of <a href="/places/britain/shropshire/index.html">Shropshire, England</a>, was among them.</p>
<p>Robert’s father and stepmother joined the LDS church Aug 1847, his sister June 1848, and Robert two months later, at age nine. Recently enacted <a href="/resources/places/british-mission/historical-overview/index.html">child labor laws</a> [Places/Britain/Coal Mining] prevented mines from hiring boys younger than ten, too late to save Robert’s older brother. When several families from their branch made plans to emigrate, Robert persuaded his widowed father to let him emigrate with the family of <a href="/genealogy-puzzles/lord-sandon/index.html">Thomas Thomas</a>, a missionary with three young sons. Robert’s age is listed as 11 on the ship’s <a href="/lists/lord-sandon-passengers/index.html">passenger list</a>, which may have been a purposeful mistake. A child 10 or younger would have been a burden; at 11 they could be of use.</p>
<p>The group arrived safely <a href="/resources/places/britain/liverpool-to-new-orleans/index.html">in New Orleans</a>; from there the immigrants would travel up the Mississippi River to <a href="/resoureces/places/exodus-from-usa/staging-areas/index.html">Kanesville, Iowa</a>, where gathering Saints lived until they were prepared for the difficult trek to Utah. Cholera was raging in New Orleans that year and had reached the trek staging areas; Robert’s guardians were among the many who died there. Robert was subsequently taken in by the next of what would be <a href="/fan/guardians/index.html">a dozen Mormon families</a> with whom he would live in Iowa, on the trail, and in Utah until he came of age.</p>
<p>Like the other boys on the trail to Zion, Robert performed the critical task of herding livestock. He then worked as a <a href="/resources/places/utah/herd-boys/index.html">herd boy</a> in the <a href="/resources/places/utah-territory/index.html">Utah Valley</a>, designated as the primary agricultural center for Utah. Robert must have been good at it; as a 15-year-old (passing as 17), he was hired by Reese brothers onto the <a href="/narratives/reese-trading-expedition/index.html">first trading expedition</a> between Salt Lake City and the new Mormon <a href="/resources/places/san-bernardino-colony/index.html">colony in San Bernardino</a>. This fabled trip was surely the basis for Robert’s 30-year career as a freighter. The traders stayed for several months with the original colonists in the <a href="/resources/places/san-bernardino-colony/fort/index.html">San Bernardino Fort</a> before making the return trip to Utah with Reese. On their way north the expedition passed a <a href="/resources/lists/haskell-train/index.html">wagon train led by a Captain Haskell</a> that comprised a large group of emigrants from the Utah Valley who had decided to settle in the new colony, many of whom were unhappy with the direction Brigham Young was taking the church.</p>
<p>The colony was thriving until the news broke that a group of radical avenging Mormons was actually behind the horrific <a href="/resources/places/utah/massacre/index.html">Mountain Meadows Massacre</a> in Utah September 11, 1856. Overnight the gentiles who had coexisted peaceably with their Mormon neighbors in San Bernardino turned against them. The nationwide outrage also brought the threat of war to the Mormons in Utah. In response, Brigham Young issued a <a href="/places/san-bernardino-colony/recall/index.html">recall</a> to the loyal Saints. While roughly half returned, many of those who remained were the disenchanted from the Haskell wagon train. By the 1860 census, Robert had left Utah for San Bernardino, and was living with the family of fellow Reese train freighter <a href="/fan/surname-list/alvah-downey/index.html">Alvah Downey</a> among others of their former Utah neighbors. Those that chose not to follow Brigham Young’s call did not necessarily leave the Mormon faith; many of the original San Bernardino pioneers joined the <a target="_blank" href="/resources/lists/rlds-san-bernadino-1867-branch-pages-18-23.pdf">Reorganized Latter Day Saints</a> when it established a branch there in 1865.</p>
<p>Robert created his own family in San Bernardino. He married <a href="/case-gallery/alice-addelaide/index.html">Alice Addelaide Case</a> (daughter of Haskell Wagon Train pioneer <a href="/trees/gashum-case/index.html">Gashum Case</a>, and they raised <a href="/trees/robert/index.html">ten children</a>, most of whom built houses near the on the same block as the <a href="/poppett-gallery/robert-albert-poppett/properties/index.html">Poppett homestead</a>.</p>
<p>This boy who grew up a virtual orphan spent most of his life surrounded by <a href="/fan/surname-list/index.html">a cohort of LDS Pioneer families</a>, and with them was active in the <a href="/fan/masons/index.html">Masons</a>, and the <a href="/poppett-gallery/newspaper-archive/index.html">Pioneer Societies</a>. But unexpectedly, Robert also had the opportunity to reunite with his family of origin. More than twenty years after last seeing his son, the father who had allowed Robert to go after a better life in Zion, newly re-baptized Mormon in Shropshire, placed a notice in the LDS newspaper seeking news of his son’s “whereabouts.” Robert paid the passage for <a href="/poppett-gallery/robert-llewellyn-poppett/index.html">his father</a> to move to San Bernardino, where he joined the RLDS and lived with his son’s family the remaining fifteen years of his life.</p>
<p>After he retired from freighting, Robert purchased a ranch in the nearby San Jacinto Mountains. A creek and canyon on <a href="/poppett-gallery/robert-albert-poppett/properties/poppett-flats/index.html">this property</a> were named for him in 1894 and the entire area still bears his name, giving this former wanderer a permanent home.</p>
