<h1 id="a-wandering-saint-finds-home">A Wandering Saint Finds Home</h1>
<p>The LDS Church sent the <a href="/resources/places/british-mission/missionaries/index.html">first group of missionaries to Britain</a> in 1837. New converts soon began coming to America; membership soared starting in 1848 after church leaders in England put out a call for all Saints to gather to Utah. In the next two years, 4,229 Mormons left Liverpool for Zion.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> My 2<sup>nd</sup> great grandfather <a href="/poppett-gallery/robert-albert-poppett/profile/index.html">Robert Poppett</a> of Shropshire, England, was among them.</p>
<p>Robert’s father and stepmother joined the LDS church Aug 1847, his sister June 1848, and Robert two months later, at age nine. Recently enacted <a href="/resources/places/british-mission/historical-overview/index.html">child labor laws</a> prevented mines from hiring boys younger than ten, too late to save Robert’s 14 year old brother. When several families from their branch made plans to emigrate, Robert persuaded his widowed father to let him go too, with the family of <a href="/fan/thomas-thomas/index.html">Thomas Thomas</a>, a missionary with three young sons. Robert’s age is listed as 11 on the ship’s <a href="/lists/lord-sandon/index.html">passenger-list</a>, which may have been a purposeful mistake. Children were seen as useful starting at age 10, and a child traveling without a family would need to have been useful.</p>
<p>The group arrived safely <a href="/resources/places/british-mission/liverpool-to-new-orleans/index.html">in New Orleans</a>; from there the immigrants would travel up the Mississippi River to <a href="/resoureces/places/staging-areas/index.html">Kanesville, Iowa</a>, where gathering Saints lived until they were prepared for the difficult trek to Utah. Immigrants brought cholera, which was raging in New Orleans, to the camps. Robert’s guardians were among the many who died in Iowa. Robert was then taken in by the next of what would be <a href="/fan/guardians/index.html">a dozen Mormon families</a> with whom he would live in Iowa, on the trail, and in Utah until he came of age.</p>
<p>Like the other boys on the trail from Kanesville to Utah, Robert performed the critical task of herding the livestock. He then worked as a <a href="/resources/places/utah/herd-boys/index.html">herd boy</a> in the <em>Utah Valley</em> [Places/Utah], where the best livestock were raised. Robert must have been good at it; as a 15-year-old (/passing as 17), he was hired by Reese brothers onto the <a href="/genealogical-puzzles/reese-train/index.html">first trading expedition</a> between Salt Lake City and the new Mormon <a href="/resources/places/san-bernardino-colony/index.html">colony in San Bernardino</a>. This fabled trip was the basis for Robert’s 30-year career as a freighter. The traders stayed for several months with the original colonists in the San Bernardino Fort before making the return trip to Utah with Reese. On their way north the expedition passed a <a href="/resources/lists/haskell-train/index.html">wagon train led by a Captain Haskell</a> that comprised a large group of emigrants from the Utah Valley who had decided to settle in the new colony, many of whom were unhappy with the direction Brigham Young was taking the church.</p>
<p>The colony was thriving until the news broke that a group of radical avenging Mormons was actually behind the horrific <a href="/resources/places/utah/massacre/index.html">Mountain Meadows Massacre</a> in Utah September 11, 1856. Overnight the gentiles who had coexisted peaceably with their Mormon neighbors in San Bernardino turned against them. The nationwide outrage also brought the threat of war to the Mormons in Utah. In response, Brigham Young issued a <a href="/resources/places/san%20bernardino-colony/overview/index.html">recall to the loyal Saints</a>. While roughly half returned, many of those who remained were the disenchanted from the Haskell wagon train. When he was 18 Robert chose make his home among these families in San Bernardino. That they had not followed Brigham Young’s call did not mean they left the Mormon faith; many of the original SB pioneers joined the <a href="/resources/lists/rlds-branch-1867/index.html">RLDS when it established a branch in SB in 1865</a>.</p>
<p>Robert created his own family in San Bernardino. He married <a href="/case-gallery/alice-addelaide/index.html">Alice Case</a> (/daughter of former polygamist <a href="/case-gallery/gashum-caleb/index.html">Gashum Case</a>, who had brought his family to San Bernardino in Haskell’s 1854 wagon train), raised <a href="/trees/robert/index.html">ten children</a>, most of whom built houses near the on the same block as the <a href="/poppett-gallery/robert-albert-poppett/properties/index.html">Poppett homestead</a>.</p>
<p>This boy who grew up a virtual orphan spent most of his life surrounded by <a href="/fan/surname-list/index.html">a cohort of LDS Pioneer families</a>, and with them was active in the <a href="/fan/masons/index.html">Masons</a>, and the <a href="/fan/pioneer-society/index.html">Pioneer Society</a>. But unexpectedly, Robert also had the opportunity to reunite with his family of origin. More than twenty years after last seeing his son, the father who had allowed Robert to go after a better life in Zion, newly re-baptized Mormon in Shropshire, placed a notice in the LDS newspaper seeking news of his son’s “whereabouts.” Robert paid the passage for <a href="/poppett-gallery/robert-llewellyn-poppett/index.html">his father</a> to move to San Bernardino, where he joined the RLDS and lived with his son’s family the remaining fifteen years of his life.</p>
<p>After he retired from freighting, Robert purchased a ranch in the nearby San Jacinto Mountains. A creek and canyon on <a href="/poppett-gallery/robert-albert-poppett/properties/index.html">this property</a> were named for him in 1894 and the entire area still bears his name, giving this former wanderer a permanent home.</p>
