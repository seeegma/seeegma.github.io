<h2 id="san-bernardino-colony-history">San Bernardino Colony History</h2>
<p>The Mormon Battalion had traveled through southern California and returned to Salt Lake City with glowing tales of California. Although Brigham Young had not originally planned on planting a settlement in California, he came to realize that having a wagon route to the Pacific would be essential for securing supplies for the Saints in Utah. A Pacific waystation would also be beneficial for the converts from Australia or the Pacific Islands on their way to Salt Lake City to equip themselves for the difficult journey through the desert. A southern location would avoid seasonal limitations from mountain snows. With this in mind, Brigham Young reluctantly sanctioned the establishment of a new colony, and appointed Aposles Amasa M. Lyman and Charles C. Rich to lead it.</p>
<p>The pioneering company of 150 wagons that gathered in Payson on the 24<sup>th</sup> of March, 1851 was far larger than the “twenty persons or so” Brigham Young expected, and his disappointment seemed to sour him on the colony from then on out. Nevertheless, the colony was planted and by all accounts thrived until Brigham Young’s disputes with the federal government in 1856 over his leadership of Utah Territory devolved into the threat of war. The crisis was magnified by the Mountain Meadows Massacre on September 11, 1856. Brigham Young soon called for the return of all Saints to Utah to defend Zion, withdrawing his support for the colony.</p>
