<p>Based on these sources, RAP’s guardian was a married man with a family, and a Mormon missionary. Robert was with him on the journey from Liverpool, across the Atlantic, and all the way to Kanesville, Iowa. The guardian died in Iowa.</p>

<p>This is a transcription of ship’s passenger list, which is in the order of the families and groups who traveled together. The captain noted that there were no deaths on the voyage.</p>
<p>The first known Mormons on the list are Thomas Thomas, and Thomas Davies. The Brinkworth family listed after Davies were not Mormon. The person at the beginning of the list (James Whitehead) is likely Mormon, though we have not yet found him in Overland Travel or other databases.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion-robert-poppetts-guardian-was">Conclusion – Robert Poppett’s Guardian was…</h1>
<p><strong>Richard Meredith,</strong> as a single man, was not his guardian. He went up the river the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers in 1849 after burying cholera dead in New Orleans, worked on flatboats near Kanesville, and joined his emigrating parents in Utah where he married.</p>
<p><strong>Thomas Davies</strong>, did remarry. He married the widow of the New Orleans’ Branch President who had several children. They moved to St. Louis and then onto Utah. There is no record of Robert living with Thomas Davies new family. (Thomas Davies was the first LDS convert of Shrewsbury the end of July 1847. Robert L. Poppet converted a month later. Robert A. Poppett’s mother was Catherine Davies. Were Thomas and Catherine related? This is a tangled next of similar names, the untangling of which is still underway.)</p>
<p>The only Mormon married couples on <em>The Lord Sandon</em> were:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>John and Harriet Evans</strong> – who did not travel with children, and</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Thomas Thomas</strong> and his wife Eliza. - the only family traveling with children.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thomas and Eliza Thomas in Britain:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>LDS records tell us that Thomas Thomas was present at baptism of Thomas Davies 27 Jul 1847 in Shropshire, and confirmed RLP 17 Aug 1848 at the Conference the following August, four months before departure.</p></li>
<li><p>We have not found any other records of the Thomas family in the UK prior to departure.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>John and Harriett Evans in Britain:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>LDS records tell us that John Evans baptized young Robert on 27 Jul 1848 in Shropshire, four months before departure.</p></li>
<li><p>We have not found any other records of a John and Harriett Evans in the UK prior to departure.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both Thomas Thomas and John Evans did the work of missionaries in the lives of several of the Mormon families on <em>The Lord Sandon</em>, but only <strong>Thomas Thomas</strong> was a married man with a family. Therefore, we conclude that Robert’s father put his son in the care of missionary Thomas Thomas and his wife Eliza for the trip to Zion.</p>
<p>We have not yet found any record of the death of Thomas Thomas other than in RAP’s biographies that state that he died in Iowa.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>T.T. #2 –</strong> He is too young to be the same Thomas Thomas from the Lord <em>Sandon.</em> His obituary confirms that he was captain of his own vessel prior to emigrating to America. - <a href="https://history.lds.org/overlandtravel/sources/11229018981587306490-eng/died-saints-herald-15-march-1877-95-96?firstName=Thomas&amp;surname=Thomas">&quot;Died,&quot; <em>Saints Herald, </em>15 March 1877, 95-96.</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>T.T.#3 - Born 1815 in Wales, died 1891 in Utah</strong>. At the time of his death he is married to an Ann Lewis, daughter of William Lewis and Sarah Gimblet, and has a son Gomer Thomas. Ann died in Utah in 1902. Since the wife’s name doesn’t match and no record of the kids, this makes it unlikely that this is RAP’s Thomas Thomas. They married before sailing-- 20 Jun 1842 – in Mynyddislwyn, Monmouth, Wales. While we entertained the possibility that the wife who died in Utah was a second wife, and that the first wife - who possibly came on the <em>Lord Sandon</em>, died – the fact that their children’s names, sex, and ages do not fit the <em>Lord Sandon</em> passenger list) rules him out.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Still another Thomas Thomas was born about 1815</strong>. He was a leader with the John A. Hunt Co, 1856. “He was a captain of ten from Wales. Evidence that he came in 1856 is also confirmed in information found in 1857 Church financial records.” It is possible that this is the T.T. #2 - we have no other facts that contradict it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>John and Hariet Evans in the US</em>:</p>
<p>The presumption is that Harriet, at least, passed away between arrival in New Orleans and the 1850 Pottawattamie census. Did John return, and come back with another wife? The <strong>Welsh Mormon History database</strong> offers only two possibilities:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>John Evans, born 5 Apr 1814 in Llanarth, Cardiganshire, Wales. Died in Iowa in 1866. S. Curling Passenger List (19 Apr 1856 Liverpool - 23 May 1856 Boston); RLDS wife Margaret, dau. Hetty. &quot;On July 5, 1868, Mr. Adamson was married to Hetty Evans, daughter of John and Margaret (Jones) Evans, both natives of Wales, Mrs. Adamson being born there. Her family came to America in 1856 in the good ship &quot;Sam Curling,&quot; a cotton ship which carried cotton to Europe and returned with passengers. They were five weeks on the way and two passengers died in crossing. Landing in Boston Harbor, the family started for Utah to join the Mormons, they having accepted that faith in Wales, where it was extensively preached, but upon arriving in Jasper County they learned of the practice of polygamy and some other things which had not been mentioned in Wales by the Mormon teachers so the new religion was discarded and the family settled in Jasper County, Mrs. Adamson being at the time twelve years of age, having been born November 26, 1843. The first year after landing in America, the mother died in Iowa, January 20, 1857, at the age of forty-two, after which Mrs. Adamson kept house for her father until his death, which occurred August 31, 1866, at the age of fifty-two. After the death of her father and mother, Mrs. Adamson made her home with John and Mary Davis until her marriage, they having no children. Mrs. Adamson is one of three children, the eldest of whom died in infancy; John Evans, a brother, resides in Fairmont, Nebraska, being a successful farmer with seven children. He was born August 27, 1849&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>John Thomas Evans, born 1 May 1823, Henllan Amgoed, Carmarthenshire, Wales. Died 1900 Utah.</p></li>
